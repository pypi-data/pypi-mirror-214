Description: # pylibffm
        
        pylibffm is a wrapper around libffm to allow using scipy and numpy arrays as input.
        pylibffm requires SSE and openmp.
        
        ## Installing
        If you're running python 3.7~3.11 on linux
        ```bash
        pip install pylibffm
        ```
        Otherwise
        ```bash
        git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Sinacam/pylibffm
        cd pylibffm
        make
        pip install .
        ```
        Currently, the distribution is incredibly hacky and cannot be pip installed from source.
        Windows build support is lacking, but code should be correct.
        
        ## Documentation
        The API consists of
        + `train`
        + `load`
        + `Model`
            + `Model.save`
            + `Model.predict`
        + `make_bin`
        + `train_with_bin`
        
        Use `help` or read their docstring for their usage.
        
        ## Diff with libffm
        To be deterministic, set openmp threads to 1. For pylibffm, do
        ```bash
        OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python <script>.py
        ```
        
        For libffm, run with `-s 1` (the default). This should yield identical models.

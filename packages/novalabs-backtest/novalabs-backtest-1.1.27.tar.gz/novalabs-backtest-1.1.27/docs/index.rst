Welcome to NovaLabs backtest documentation!
===========================================

**NovaLabs backtest** is a Python library for backtesting algorithmic trading 
strategies. It aims to facilitate the development of algorithmic trading on the
**crypto market** by downloading historical data prices on the biggest centralized
exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, KuCoin & more) and simulates the trades of
a given strategy throughout past years. It returns a bunch of statistics, giving a
strong evaluation of your strategies performances.


Check out the :doc:`installation` to see how to install the project and the 
:doc:`usage` section for further information.
We created a example for you to understand easily how to create and backtest
your own strategy (cf. :doc:`usage`).

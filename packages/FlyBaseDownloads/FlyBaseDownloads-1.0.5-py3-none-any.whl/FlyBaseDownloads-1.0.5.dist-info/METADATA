# FlyBaseDownloads

Python package to facilitate the data download from FlyBase. Most of the available data from their official wiki can be downloaded. One of the purposes of this library is to organize the data as closely as possible to the source, **FlyBase**. Despite not being the official package, it is organized by data class/type and provides direct downloads of the current bulk data files from the FTP site.
For more information, visit the [official FlyBase wiki](https://wiki.flybase.org/wiki/FlyBase:Downloads_Overview).

1. Install the library using the pip command.

    > pip install FlyBaseDownloads

2. Import the library into your file.

    > import FlyBaseDownloads as FBD

3. Access the different classes of the library described below.

The file is generated by testing for overlaps, no matter how small, of the locations of Affy1 oligos in the genome with the locations of gene exons, as defined by the Dmel gene models for the current release of FlyBase. If the location of an Affy1 oligo shows any kind of overlap with an exon of a gene, a Gene=>Affy reference is recorded in this file.

The extent of the overlap has no influence on the inclusion of a crossreference in this file. The overlap might be just one nucleotide, or it could be an exact match to the exon. For interpretation of the significance of a partial overlap please contact Affymetrix.

The file includes the following Dmel genes:

 - Nuclear genes located to the sequence


it excludes:
 - genes not located to the sequence
 - mitochondrial genes

|gene_EC_name	|The EC name(s) associated with the gene, if present. Multiple entries are separated with a pipe. (This is computed, corresponding to the EC cross-reference(s) on any positive GO molecular function term(s) annotated to the gene.)|

If you want to build ctffind from source, see below.


1. Check dependencies

There are two dependencies: wxWidgets >= 3.0 and either FFTW or Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL)

1.1 wxWidgets

To check that you have wxWidgets installed, do:

which wx-config

To check you have the correct version of wxWidgets, do:

wx-config --version

If you have several versions of wxWidgets installed, you may have to do e.g.:

wx-config-3.0 --version

or:

/path/to/wx-config --version

and add the following flag to your configure line: --with-wx-config=/path/to/wx-config-3.0



1.2 Intel MKL

If it is available on your system, the configure script should detect Intel's MKL and ensure that the program will be linked against it. This is preferred as it gives a significant performance boost.


1.3 FFTW

If the MKL is not available, you need to ensure FFTW is installed.





2. Configure

See configure --help for details of available options. 

For optimal performance, we recommend: --disable-debugmode --enable-mkl





3. Build and install

make && make install

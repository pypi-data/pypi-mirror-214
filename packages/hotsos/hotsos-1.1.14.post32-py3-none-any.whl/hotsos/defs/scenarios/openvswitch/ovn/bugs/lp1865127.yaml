      message: >-
        The version of ovn on this node is affected by a known bug where the
        ovn-controller logs are being spammed with error messages containing
        "No bridge for localnet port ..." when that is in fact not an error.
        Upgrading to a version >= 20.12.0 will fix the issue.

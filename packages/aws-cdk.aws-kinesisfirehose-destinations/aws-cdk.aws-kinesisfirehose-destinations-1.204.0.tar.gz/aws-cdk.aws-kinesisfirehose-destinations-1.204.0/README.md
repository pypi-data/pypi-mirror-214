This library provides constructs for adding destinations to a Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
delivery stream. Destinations can be added by specifying the `destinations` prop when
defining a delivery stream.

See [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose module README](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-kinesisfirehose-readme.html) for usage examples.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_kinesisfirehose_destinations as destinations
```

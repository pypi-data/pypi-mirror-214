# Data Management and Visualization for Benchmarking Deep Learning Training Systems Frontend
This is the frontend for the framework. Keep in mind that without the backend this service might not work properly.
The frontend is a react app that can be hosted on a separate server or on the same server.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

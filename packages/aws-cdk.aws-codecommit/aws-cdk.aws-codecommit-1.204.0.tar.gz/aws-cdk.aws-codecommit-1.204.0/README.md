AWS CodeCommit is a version control service that enables you to privately store and manage Git repositories in the AWS cloud.

For further information on CodeCommit,
see the [AWS CodeCommit documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit).

To add a CodeCommit Repository to your stack:

```python
repo = codecommit.Repository(self, "Repository",
    repository_name="MyRepositoryName",
    description="Some description."
)
```

Use the `repositoryCloneUrlHttp`, `repositoryCloneUrlSsh` or `repositoryCloneUrlGrc`
property to clone your repository.

To add an Amazon SNS trigger to your repository:

```python
# repo: codecommit.Repository


# trigger is established for all repository actions on all branches by default.
repo.notify("arn:aws:sns:*:123456789012:my_topic")
```

## Add initial commit

It is possible to initialize the Repository via the `Code` class.
It provides methods for loading code from a directory, `.zip` file and from a pre-created CDK Asset.

Example:

```python
repo = codecommit.Repository(self, "Repository",
    repository_name="MyRepositoryName",
    code=codecommit.Code.from_directory(path.join(__dirname, "directory/"), "develop")
)
```

## Events

CodeCommit repositories emit Amazon CloudWatch events for certain activities.
Use the `repo.onXxx` methods to define rules that trigger on these events
and invoke targets as a result:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_sns as sns
import aws_cdk.aws_events_targets as targets

# repo: codecommit.Repository
# project: codebuild.PipelineProject
# my_topic: sns.Topic


# starts a CodeBuild project when a commit is pushed to the "master" branch of the repo
repo.on_commit("CommitToMaster",
    target=targets.CodeBuildProject(project),
    branches=["master"]
)

# publishes a message to an Amazon SNS topic when a comment is made on a pull request
rule = repo.on_comment_on_pull_request("CommentOnPullRequest",
    target=targets.SnsTopic(my_topic)
)
```

## CodeStar Notifications

To define CodeStar Notification rules for Repositories, use one of the `notifyOnXxx()` methods.
They are very similar to `onXxx()` methods for CloudWatch events:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_chatbot as chatbot

# repository: codecommit.Repository

target = chatbot.SlackChannelConfiguration(self, "MySlackChannel",
    slack_channel_configuration_name="YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME",
    slack_workspace_id="YOUR_SLACK_WORKSPACE_ID",
    slack_channel_id="YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID"
)
rule = repository.notify_on_pull_request_created("NotifyOnPullRequestCreated", target)
```

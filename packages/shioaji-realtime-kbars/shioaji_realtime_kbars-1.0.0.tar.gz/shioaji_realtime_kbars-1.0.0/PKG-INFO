## About The Project

When you use Shioaji Python API for technical analysis, you may need real-time data, and in different time dimensions, this package can help you subscribe to tick data and convert it into Kbars type (exactly the same as Shioaji Kbars ), to assist you in converting from Kbars to use more immediate data.

## Built With

 Here are a few examples.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/NickLin910221/Shioaji_Realtime_Kline/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

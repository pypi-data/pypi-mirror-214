# 🙊 LMAO
> **L**anguage **M**odel **A**dapter **O**bjects <br> _A toolkit for adapting LLMs to perform downstream NLP tasks_ 🦾

<br>

`lmao` is an open-source library for integrating large language models (LLMs) from providers like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) and [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/docs/api) into your NLP workflows. For example, it can be used to pre-annotate text datasets using few-shot learning with Claude or GPT-4. `lmao` is in the (very) early stages of development. New features will be added with high cadence and documentation is coming soon.

## Installation
The package is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:
```bash
pip install lmao-nlp
```

## Development

To install the development version, clone the repository and install the package in editable mode with the `dev` extra:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnnygreco/lmao.git
cd lmao
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If you want to install all the optional dependencies (e.g., to build the docs), use the `all` extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## LM Clients
The plan is to add support for all major LM providers (both for external API-based models and locally run models). Currently, the following providers are supported:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)
- [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.ai/docs)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/docs/api)

You'll need an activate API key from one or more of these providers to use `lmao`.

## Quickstart

### 🤖 Create a ChatGPT chatbot
```python
from lmao import factory

# create a chatbot using OpenAI's ChatGPT under the hood
chatbot = factory.create_chatbot("openai")

response = chatbot.chat("Hello! Tell me a joke, please!")

print(response.text)
# output: Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!

# the chatbot object keeps track of the chat history
response = chatbot.chat("Haha! Can you please explain why this is funny?")

print(response.text)
# output: This joke is funny because it plays on the idea of personification,
# where the tomato is given human-like characteristics, such as being able to
# see and react to its environment. It also sets up an expectation that there
# is a serious reason for the tomato turning red, but the punchline delivers
# a silly and unexpected twist, which makes it humorous. Finally, the wordplay
# on "dressing" which sounds similar to "stressin'" adds to the comedic effect.
```

### 😀 😐 😖 Perform sentiment analysis with Cohere
```python
from lmao import factory

# create a sentiment analysis task using an adapter
# for Cohere's command-xlarge-nightly
model = factory.create_task("sentiment_analysis", "cohere")

# predict sentiment of the given text
result = model.predict("This lmao package is awesome!")

print(result.prediction)
# output: 'positive'
```

### 🪐 Solve Fermi Problems with Claude!
```python
from lmao import factory

# create a Fermi Task task using an adapter for Anthropic's Claude
fermi = factory.create_task("fermi_problem", "anthropic")

# ask a Fermi-Problem style question
response = fermi.ask("How many piano tuners are there in New York city?")

print(response.text)
# output:
# Here is a step by step approach to estimate this:
# 1) New York city population: Around 8.5 million people
# 2) Assume a typical piano tuning needs to be done once per year.
#    Also assume 1 piano for every 100 people.
# 3) So number of pianos in NYC = 8.5 million * 1/100 = 85,000 pianos
# 4) Assume a piano tuner can tune around 2-3 pianos per day. So in a year
#    (365 days) they can tune around 800-1200 pianos.
# 5) Number of piano tuners needed = Number of pianos / Number of pianos a
#    tuner can tune in a year = 85,000 / 1000 = 85 piano tuners

# So my estimate is there are around 85 full-time piano tuners in
# New York City. Of course, there are assumptions and approximations in this
# estimate, but I think this approach gives a reasonable order of magnitude
# estimate using logical thinking and reasoning. Let me know if you would
# like me to clarify or expand on any part of the solution.

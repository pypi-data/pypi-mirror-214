This library contains a set of classes which can be used as CloudWatch Alarm actions.

The currently implemented actions are: EC2 Actions, SNS Actions, SSM OpsCenter Actions, Autoscaling Actions and Application Autoscaling Actions

## EC2 Action Example

```python
# Alarm must be configured with an EC2 per-instance metric
# alarm: cloudwatch.Alarm

# Attach a reboot when alarm triggers
alarm.add_alarm_action(
    actions.Ec2Action(actions.Ec2InstanceAction.REBOOT))
```

## SSM OpsCenter Action Example

```python
# alarm: cloudwatch.Alarm

# Create an OpsItem with specific severity and category when alarm triggers
alarm.add_alarm_action(
    actions.SsmAction(actions.OpsItemSeverity.CRITICAL, actions.OpsItemCategory.PERFORMANCE))
```

See `@aws-cdk/aws-cloudwatch` for more information.

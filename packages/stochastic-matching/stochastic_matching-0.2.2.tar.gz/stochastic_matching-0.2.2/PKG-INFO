--------
Features
--------

* Theoretical analysis:
    * Injectivity/surjectivity of the graph, kernel description.
    * Polytope description of positive solutions.
* Fast simulator.
    * Provided with a large set of greedy / non-greedy policies.

---------------------
Installation
---------------------

To install Stochastic Matching, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install stochastic_matching

This is the preferred method to install Stochastic Matching, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

=======
History
=======

------------------------------------------------
0.2.2 (2023-06-18): Improved CCDF
------------------------------------------------

* Add a function to draw the (discrete) CCDFs piecewise
* New range of officially supported Python versions: 3.6 -> 3.11

------------------------------------------------
0.2.1 (2022-02-03): Big little update
------------------------------------------------

* New optimize_rates for Model. Outputs a flow that optimizes the rates according to some reward weights.
* Refactoring: policies formerly called semi-greedy are now called (semi)-filtering.
* New option weights for filtering policies. Auto-computes the forbidden edges to optimize the reward according to weights.
* Default model tolerance raised to 1e-7 for better detection of null edges.
* Tutorials modified to introduce the new features.
* The notebook used for paper https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03502084 is now included in the documentation.
* Bug hunt: very large simulation could overflow silently (solved by switching logs from uint32 to uint64).

-----------------------------------
0.2.0 (2022-01-24): Brand new API
-----------------------------------

As the package is at early stage, it had to go through a lot of refactoring.
Hopefully, the result should be more easy to use.

Major changes:

* API completely unified
    * Beginners (and intermediate) users should always go through the Model class to use the package.
    * Advanced users: the documentation reference is your oyster!
* New features
    * A few new graph models.
    * New analysis tools: left kernel, right kernel basis change and display (for simple graphs),
      injectivity/surjectivity, connected components, spanners, and vertices!
    * New policies for the simulator: *priority* and *semi-greedy*!

Minor changes:

* Default rates are proportional to degree (but you can ask for 'uniform')
* We have a logo!
* Hunt for typos in documentation.
* Notebooks tutorials have been updated to cope with the new API.


---------------------------------
0.1.0 (2022-01-13): First release
---------------------------------

* First release on PyPI.
* Refactoring: the package name for the public release is *Stochastic Matching*.
* The graph submodule has been revamped a bit:
    * Obtaining graphs by concatenation of other graphs is now more systematic and optimized.
    * Names of generators have been changes to comply with *official* terminology from Wolfram.
    * A few more generators have been added (e.g. complete, lollipop, barbell).
* Current compatibility: 3.6 -> 3.9


----------------------------------------
0.0.4 (2021-09-30): Misc. improvements
----------------------------------------

* Add possibility to specify node names. The names are used for all display operations
* New simulator method compute_ccdf to allow access outside show_ccdf
* Simulator method show_ccdf has two new options: indices (only show some nodes), sort
* New simulator method compute_average_queues
* New simulator method show_average_queues with three options: indices (only show some nodes), sort,
  and as_time (divide by arrival rates)
* New *Getting started* notebook.
* Doctests parameters adjusted for faster test suite execution



----------------------------------------
0.0.3 (2021-08-24): Simulators are back!
----------------------------------------

This update reintroduces simulators, fully revamped

* All simulators are built as a hierarchy of classes
    * Simulator is the mother abstract class
    * QueueSizeSimulator is dedicated to greedy simulators that only use the queue sizes:
      RandomNode, RandomItem, and LongestQueue.
    * QueueStateSimulator is dedicated to greedy simulators that use the age of items:
      FCFM.
    * VQSimulator is a fast implementation of the virtual queue algorithm.
* All non-abstract simulators have a string name. The new `get_simulator_classes()`
  gives a dict of them that can be used to easily select a given simulator.
* Lots of refactoring
    * nodes and edges attributes from graph renamed as incidence and co_incidence respectively.
      Older incidence attribute (plain matrix) removed.
    * spectral.py moved up to main module
    * New simulator module
    * simulator.py split into classes.py and a few other files inside the simulator module.
* Jit is disabled for the testing (allows for inner coverage inspection).
* Tutorials revamped to cope with 0.0.3.
* Old files removed from git for cleanliness


---------------------------------------
0.0.2 (2021-07-22): Hyper-graph release
---------------------------------------

Lots of changes in this update.

* Graph API has been fully revamped. There is now a GenericGraph class from which SimpleGraph and HyperGraph are derived.
    * Hypergraphs don't have any adjacency attribute, only incidence. They are displayed as bipartite graphs between
      nodes and edges, with an option to explicitly separate nodes from edges.
    * Simple graphs are mostly similar but not compatible with previous Graph class.
    * Hovering on edge now show edge id and description, e.g. edge 6 between nodes 1 and 4 will show "6: (1, 4)"
* TWO HYPERGRAPHS GENERATORS have been added to the mix:
    * hyper_dumbbells can create the candy and larger sweets with trivial kernel.
    * fan can create hypergraphs with more complex kernels, possibly with bipartite-like degenerescence
* The old gramian module is now called spectral.
    * All internals have switched from gramian-based computation to incidence-based computation,
      which makes it fully hypergraph ready (multiplicity / loops should work, but are not tested yet).
    * NEW MAXIMIN FLOW COMPUTATION! No need to optimize each edge, one single linear optimization is enough and
      the result maximizes the minimal edge flow.
    * is_stable method checks the graph kernel dimension and existence of a positive solution.
* Main class as been revamped as well
    * Class name is now MQ (could be changed later).
    * When displayed, flows are checked by default. Conservation law issues gives red nodes, negative edges are red,
      null edges are orange (can be disabled).
    * SIMULATION ENGINE NOT AVAILABLE IN 0.0.2, as there are a lot of things to change. It will return in 0.0.3.
* Misc:
    * Tutorials (simulation apart) have been updated. Enjoy the double degenerated fan!
    * Local coverage computation. Enforcing 100% coverage on all 0.0.2+ code.
    * Minor changes in the display module to cope with the new graph API.

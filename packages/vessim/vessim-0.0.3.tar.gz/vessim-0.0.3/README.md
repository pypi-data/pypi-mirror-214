Vessim is a versatile co-simulation testbed for carbon-aware applications and systems.
It lets users connect domain-specific simulators for energy system components like renewable power generation, 
energy storage, and power flow analysis with real software and hardware.

Vessim is in alpha stage and under active development.
Functionality and documentation will improve in the next weeks an months.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install the [latest release](https://pypi.org/project/vessim/) of Vessim via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

# ChartStag

## v0.8.2

ChartStag is an extension for the [SciStag](https://github.com/scistag/scistag) package
which supports you in your computer vision, data science and data engineering
projects.

It extends SciStag with diagram and chart plotting capabilities. As of now solely by
integrating [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid), an awesome diagram and
charting tool written in JavaScript, into SciStag VisualLog.

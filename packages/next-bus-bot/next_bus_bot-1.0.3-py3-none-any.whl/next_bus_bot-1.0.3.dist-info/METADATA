===============
Next Bus Bot
===============

A bot/ cli tool that simply gives you the waiting times for next buses at your favorite bus stop.

It works only for the IDFM/RATP Network, relying on the api ``lines/v4``. For now only a handfull of bus stops on the Plateau de Saclay are registered, but you can add your own


.. warning::

   I am not responsible if you arrive late at your work.
   For serious travel planning, use your favorite app.

Example
-------
::

   $ nbb mdv
   Next buses at Mare du Vivier:
   - ⏰  6 min. (12:29)  9️⃣ 🚍 ▶ Centre Commercial Ulis 2
   - ⏰ 27 min. (12:50)  9️⃣ 🚍 ▶ Gare de Jouy en Josas
   - ⏰ 35 min. (12:58)  9️⃣ 🚍 ▶ Centre Commercial Ulis 2
   - ⏰ 53 min. (13:16)  9️⃣ 🚍 ▶ Christ de Saclay

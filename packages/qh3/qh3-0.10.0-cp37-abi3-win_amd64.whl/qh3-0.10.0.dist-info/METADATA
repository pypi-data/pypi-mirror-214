What is ``qh3``?
----------------

``qh3`` is a fork of the awesome ``aioquic`` library pending its author return.
Important changes / improvements are:
- Made abi3 compatible, no need to build the wheel all over again on each interpreter version.
- Only one dependency left! Cryptography will remain as long as Python does not ship with proper QUIC implementation.
- Mitigated deprecated match_hostname.
- Mimic load_default_certs ssl context.

``aioquic`` is a library for the QUIC network protocol in Python. It features
a minimal TLS 1.3 implementation, a QUIC stack and an HTTP/3 stack.

QUIC was standardised in `RFC 9000`_ and HTTP/3 in `RFC 9114`_.
``aioquic`` is regularly tested for interoperability against other
`QUIC implementations`_.

To learn more about ``aioquic`` please `read the documentation`_.

Why should I use ``aioquic``?
-----------------------------

``aioquic`` has been designed to be embedded into Python client and server
libraries wishing to support QUIC and / or HTTP/3. The goal is to provide a
common codebase for Python libraries in the hope of avoiding duplicated effort.

Both the QUIC and the HTTP/3 APIs follow the "bring your own I/O" pattern,
leaving actual I/O operations to the API user. This approach has a number of
advantages including making the code testable and allowing integration with
different concurrency models.

Features
--------

- QUIC stack conforming with `RFC 9000`_
- HTTP/3 stack conforming with `RFC 9114`_
- minimal TLS 1.3 implementation conforming with `RFC 8446`_
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- connection migration and NAT rebinding
- logging TLS traffic secrets
- logging QUIC events in QLOG format
- HTTP/3 server push support

Requirements
------------

``aioquic`` requires Python 3.7 or better, and the OpenSSL development headers.

Linux
.....

On Debian/Ubuntu run:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt install libssl-dev python3-dev

On Alpine Linux run:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apk add openssl-dev python3-dev bsd-compat-headers libffi-dev

OS X
....

On OS X run:

.. code-block:: console

   brew install openssl

You will need to set some environment variables to link against OpenSSL:

.. code-block:: console

   export CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
   export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib

Windows
.......

On Windows the easiest way to install OpenSSL is to use `Chocolatey`_.

.. code-block:: console

   choco install openssl

You will need to set some environment variables to link against OpenSSL:

.. code-block:: console

  $Env:INCLUDE = "C:\Progra~1\OpenSSL-Win64\include"
  $Env:LIB = "C:\Progra~1\OpenSSL-Win64\lib"

Running the examples
--------------------

`aioquic` comes with a number of examples illustrating various QUIC usecases.

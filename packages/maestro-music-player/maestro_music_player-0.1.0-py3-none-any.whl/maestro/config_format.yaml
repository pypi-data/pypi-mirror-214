            Whether maestro should try to extract the index of a song from it’s filename

            If set, maestro will look for numbers in music filenames and sort songs in 
            an album based on those indexes. Songs without index are put at the end.
            If multiple songs have the same index (or no index), they are sorted
            in alphabetical order.
           
            When this option is disabled, songs are sorted in alphabetical order.
        type: bool
        default: True

keys: 
    description: | 
        You can bind any key to a maestro command

        There are 3 modes in which you can bind keys

        - normal: this is the default mode when using the app

        - command: when the in-app command line is focused

        - popup: when an information popup is displayed

        A key can only be mapped once in each mode

    normal:

            The default mode when using the app

            You probably want to bind most of your commands here
        type: mapping
        default: {}

    command:
        description: |
            Active when the in-app command line is focused

            You probably don’t want to bind many keys here, as it would make it
            impossible to type text in the command line
        type: mapping
        default: {}

    popup:
        description: |
            Active when an information popup is displayed

            You will need at least a key to dismiss the popup here
        type: mapping
        default: {}

    description: You can set a light or dark theme for the application

    name:

        description: Name of the color scheme to use

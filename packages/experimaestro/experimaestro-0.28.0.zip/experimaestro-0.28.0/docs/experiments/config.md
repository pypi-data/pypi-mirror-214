# Configurations

Defining experiments is based on _config(urations)_ and _tasks_. Tasks are configurations that can be executed.

## Defining a configuration

A configuration is defined whenever an object derives from `Config`.

When an identifier is not given, it is computed as `__module__.__qualname__`. In that case,
it is possible to shorten the definition using the `Config` class as a base class.

!!! example

    ```py3
    from experimaestro import Param, Config

    class MyModel(Config):
        __xpmid__ = "my.model"

        gamma: Param[float]
    ```

defines a configuration with name `my.model` and one argument `gamma` that has the type `float`.

`__xpmid__` can also be a class method to generate dynamic ids for all descendant configurations
When `__xpmid__` is missing, the qualified name is used.

## Deprecating a configuration or attributes

When a configuration is moved (or equivalently its `__xpmid__` changed), its signature
changes, and thus the same tasks can be run twice. To avoid this, use the `@deprecate`
annotation.

!!! example

    ```py3
    from experimaestro import Param, Config, deprecate

    class NewConfiguration(Config):
        pass

    @deprecate
    class OldConfiguration(NewConfiguration):
        # Only pass is allowed here
        pass
    ```

It is possible to deprecate a parameter or option:

!!! example

    ```py3
    from experimaestro import Param, Config, deprecate

    class Learning(Config):
        losses: Param[List[Loss]] = []

        @deprecate
        def loss(self, value):
            # Checking that the new param is not used
            assert len(self.losses) == 0
            # We allow several losses to be defined now
            self.losses.append(value)

    ```

**Warning** the signature will change when deprecating attributes


To fix the identifiers, one can use the `deprecated` command. This
will create symbolic links so that old jobs are preserved and
re-used.

```sh
experimaestro deprecated list WORKDIR
```


### Object life cycle

During [task](../task) execution, the objects are constructed following
these steps:

- The object is constructed using `self.__init__()`
- The attributes are set (e.g. `gamma` in the example above)
- `self.__post_init__()` is called (if the method exists)
- Pre-tasks are ran (if any, see below)

Sometimes, it is necessary to postpone a part of the initialization of a configuration
object because it depends on an external processing. In this case, the `initializer` decorator can
be used:

```py3
from experimaestro import Config, initializer

class MyConfig(Config):
    # The decorator ensures the initializer can only be called once
    @initializer
    def initialize(self, ...):
        # Do whatever is needed
        pass

```

### Pre-tasks

Sometimes one might need to modify an object after it has been initialized. For instance,
for a trained machine learning model, it is necessary to load the parameters from disk after
the model has been initialized. In this case, one can use the `add_pretasks` method
for configurations that allow

```py3
class Model(Config):
    ...

class LoadParameters(PathSerializationLWTask):
    def execute(self):
        # Here, we can load the parameters
        self.value.load(self.path)

class Trainer(Task):
    model: Param[Config]

    def task_outputs(self, dep):
        model = dep(copyconfig(self.model))
        # Note the "add_pretasks" here
        return model.add_pretasks(LoadParameters(value=model, path=".../..."))

        # For a PathSerializationLWTask, can be shortened into
        LoadParameters.construct(model, path=".../...")

    def execute(self):
        ...

# Trained model can be used later - the parameters
# learned during training are automatically loaded.
trained_model = Trainer(model=Model()).submit()

```


## Types

Possible types are:

- basic Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`) and paths `pathlib.Path`
- lists, using `typing.List[T]`
- enumerations, using `Enum` from the `enum` package
- dictionaries (support for basic types in keys only) with `typing.Dict[U, V]`
- Other configurations

## Parameters

```py3
class MyConfig(Config):
    """My configuration

    Long description of the configuration.

    Attributes:
        x: The parameter x
        y: The parameter y
    """
    # With default value
    x: Param[type] = value

    # Alternative syntax, useful to avoid class properties
    x: Annotated[type, default(value)]

    # Without default value
    y: Param[type]

    # Using a docstring
    z: Param[int]
    """Most important parameter of the model"""
```

- `name` defines the name of the argument, which can be retrieved by the instance `self` (class) or passed as an argument (function)
- `type` is the type of the argument (more details below)
- `value` default value of the argument (if any). _If the value equals to the default, the argument will not be included in the signature computation_. This allows to add new parameters without changing the signature of past experiments (if the configuration is equivalent with the default value of course, otherwise do not use a default value!).

### Constants

Constants are special parameters that cannot be modified. They are useful to note that the
behavior of a configuration/task has changed, and thus that the signature should not be the
same (as the result of the processing will differ).

```py3
class MyConfig(Config):
    # Constant
    version: Constant[str] = "2.1"
```

### Metadata

Metadata are parameters which are ignored during the signature computation. For instance, the human readable name of a model would be a metadata. They are declared as parameters, but using the `Meta` type hint

```py3
class MyConfig(Config):
    """
    Attributes:
        count: The number of documents in the collection
    """
    count: Meta[type]
```

It is also possible to dynamically change the type of an argument using the `setmeta` method:

```py3
from experimaestro import setmeta

# Forces the parameter to be a meta-parameter
a = setmeta(A(), True)

# Forces the parameter to be a meta-parameter
a = setmeta(A(), False)

```

### Path option

It is possible to define special options that will be set
to paths relative to the task directory. For instance,

```py3
class MyConfig(Config):
    output: Annotated[Path, pathgenerator("output.txt")]
```

defines the instance variable `path` as a path `.../output.txt` within
the task directory. To ensure there are no conflicts, paths
are defined by following the config/task path, i.e. if the executed
task has a parameter `model`, `model` has a parameter `optimization`,
and optimization a path parameter `loss.txt`, then the file will be
`./out/model/optimization/loss.txt`.

## Validation

If a configuration has a `__validate__` method, it is called to validate
the values before a task is submitted. This allows to fail fast when parameters
are not valid.

```py3
class ModelLearn(Config):
    batch_size: Param[int] = 100
    micro_batch_size: Param[int] = 100
    parameters: Annotated[Path, pathgenerator("parameters.pth")]

    def __validate__(self):
        assert self.batch_size % self.micro_batch_size == 0
```

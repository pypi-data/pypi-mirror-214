# Elapse Secrets Filters

Elapse Secrets Filters is a Python package designed to help you search and mask sensitive information in a body of text using pre-defined regular expressions. This package includes filters for common secrets like AWS keys, Github tokens, API keys, and much more.

The package provides two main functions:

1. `filter_elapse_secrets(text: str) -> str` - Uses the predefined regex filters to search and mask (with asterisks) any matching sensitive information in the input text.

2. `find_error_in_regex(yaml_file: str) -> None` - Checks the YAML file containing regex rules for any incorrect patterns and logs the error if any are found.

## Getting Started

1. Install elapse-secrets

   ```bash
   pip install elapse-secrets
   ```

## Usage

This is a basic usage example.

```python
from elapse_secrets import filter_elapse_secrets

text_with_secrets = "My AWS Access Key is AKIAYOURACCESSKEYHERE"
filtered_text = filter_elapse_secrets(text_with_secrets)
print(filtered_text)
# Output: My AWS Access Key is ********
```

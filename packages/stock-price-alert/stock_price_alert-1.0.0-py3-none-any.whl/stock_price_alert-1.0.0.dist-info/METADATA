StockPriceBot
=============

StockPriceBot is a Python library that provides a Telegram bot for retrieving stock prices and setting price alerts.
With this library, users can easily get the current price of a stock, set reminders for specific price levels, and receive notifications when the price reaches the set limits.

Features
--------

- Get the current price of a stock by providing the stock symbol.
- Set price alerts for stocks with custom upper and lower limits.
- Receive notifications when the price reaches the set limits.

Installation
------------

You can install StockPriceBot using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

Usage
-----

To use StockPriceBot in your Python code, you need to obtain a Telegram Bot API token. You can create a bot and get the token from the BotFather on Telegram.

Here's an example of how to use the library:

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   from stockpricebot import StockPriceBot

   # Get the bot token from the environment variable.
   bot_token = os.environ["BOT_TOKEN"]

   # Create a new bot instance.
   bot = StockPriceBot(bot_token)

   # Start the bot.
   bot.run()

# cg-flake8-reporter

A Flae8 reporter plugin for CodeGrade AutoTest v2.

This plugin writes messages to CodeGrade AutoTest v2's structured output channel.
For each violation Flake8 reports, a `comments` message is written as described
in CodeGrade's documentation. When Flake8 finishes its analysis, a final message
is written with the amount of points that were achieved in the code quality run.

## Configuration

In order to use the custom reporter, make sure you have installed both Flake8
and this package:

```bash
python3 -m pip install flake8==6.0.0
python3 -m pip install cg-flake8-reporter
```

This reporter is registered with Flake8 as `cg-flake8-reporter`, to use it run
flake with the option `--format=cg-flake8-reporter`.

The custom reporter adds a few new options to Flake8: `cg-points-deducted`,
`cg-flake8-fd` and `cg-base-path`.

### cg-points-deducted

The `cg-points-deducted` option makes it possible to configure the amount of
points (in percentage) that each violation deducts from the total points.

The `cg-points-deducted` expectes a string in the following format as input:

```bash
'info:<percentage>,warning:<percentage>,error:<percentage>'
```

Each of the violation levels must be present in the provided string. The
percentage provided should be an integer number **without** the `%` symbol.

If you wish for a violation level to not deduct points, simply set it to `0`.

### cg-flake8-fd

The `cg-flake8-fd` option makes it possible to configure where the reporter
will write its output. By default, the value is `1`, which means the reporter
will write to `stdout`. Within AutoTest v2 it is recommended to use file
descriptor `3` so that the comments will be visible in CodeGrade's UI. The
_Flake8_ step will already set this up for you.

### cg-base-path

The `cg-base-path` allows you to restrict which files the reporter will report.
For example, if you only want files to be reported within the `server` directory
of the student, you may want to set `--cg-base-path=~/student/server/`. Beware,
the _Flake8_ step always sets `cg-base-path` to the root of the student's
workspace. If you want to customize this, you should use a _Custom Test_ step
instead.

## Usage

To run Flake8 with the custom reporter:

```bash
python3 -m flake8 \
    --format=cg-flake8-reporter \
    --cg-points-deducted='info:1,warning:3,error:5' \
    --cg-flake8-fd=1 \
    ./
```

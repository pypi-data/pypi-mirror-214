The summarization of research articles is a complex task compared to general-purpose summaries.This is a result of
the distict nature or semantic structure of these scientific articles. The presence of inline citations and summarization
modules bias to certain Text features that often work well on less-tecnical text but fail to produce coherence in 
this area are all underlying factors.

We circumvent these challenges in order to produce more coherent, human-understandable summaries of manuscripts and research text
using this libary.

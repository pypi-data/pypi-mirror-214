# This is a configuration file used by xdmod_ondemand_export.py.
#
# Set the value of "url" in the [destination] section to specify where the logs
# will be POSTed.
#
# Set the values in the [logs] section to tell the script where to find logs
# and how to parse them.
#
# The values in the [prev_run] section will be overwritten in-place in this
# file by the script when it runs. The value of "last_line" will be set to the
# last line in the last successfully-POSTed file. The value of
# "last_request_time" will be set to the %t value of "last_line". In subsequent
# runs, lines will only be processed if their %t value is greater than or equal
# to "last_request_time" (but if a line identical to "last_line" is
# encountered, it will be ignored). Thus, to control which lines are processed,
# you can set the value of "last_request_time" to be before the %t value of the
# first line you want processed; just make sure the value of
# "last_request_time" is in the format [%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z], e.g.,
# [31/May/2023:23:59:59 -0500].

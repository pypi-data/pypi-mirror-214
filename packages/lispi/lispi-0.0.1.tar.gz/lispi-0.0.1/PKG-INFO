```

## Usage

To use ess, follow these steps:

1. Import the `ess` class from the package:

   ```python
    import ess
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `InteractiveSlidesGenerator` class:

   ```python

   ```

3. Specify the Jupyter notebook file you want to convert:

   ```python
   notebook_file = "path/to/your/notebook.ipynb"
   ```

4. Generate the interactive slides:

   ```python
   generator.generate_slides(notebook_file)
   ```

5. The package will convert the Jupyter notebook into interactive slides and save the output HTML file.

## Configuration

Ess provides several configuration options to customize the output slides. You can pass these options as arguments when creating an instance of the `ess` class. Here are the available configuration options:

```python
from ess import ess

# Create an instance of the ess class
generator = ess()

# Specify the Jupyter notebook file
notebook_file = "path/to/your/notebook.ipynb"

# Generate the interactive slides
generator.generate_slides(notebook_file)
```

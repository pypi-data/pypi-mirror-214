# NOTE(@NiklasRosenstein): Need to pin transitive dependency markdown-it under 3.0 because it dropped Python 3.9
#       support after that version. Technically this shouldn't be a big issue for runtime, but Mypy checks site
#       packages and complains about the walrus operator used in it when it checks site-packages.

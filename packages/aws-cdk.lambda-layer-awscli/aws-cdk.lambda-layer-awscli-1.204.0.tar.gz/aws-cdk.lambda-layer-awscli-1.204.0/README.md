This module exports a single class called `AwsCliLayer` which is a `lambda.Layer` that bundles the AWS CLI.

Any Lambda Function that uses this layer must use a Python 3.x runtime.

Usage:

```python
# AwsCliLayer bundles the AWS CLI in a lambda layer
from aws_cdk.lambda_layer_awscli import AwsCliLayer

# fn: lambda.Function

fn.add_layers(AwsCliLayer(self, "AwsCliLayer"))
```

The CLI will be installed under `/opt/awscli/aws`.

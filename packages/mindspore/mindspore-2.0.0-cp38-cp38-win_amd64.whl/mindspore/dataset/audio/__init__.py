This module is to support audio augmentations.
It includes two parts: audio transforms and utils.
audio transforms is a high performance processing module with common audio operations.
utils provides some general methods for audio processing.

Common imported modules in corresponding API examples are as follows:

.. code-block::

    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    import mindspore.dataset.audio as audio
    from mindspore.dataset.audio import utils

Alternative and equivalent imported audio module is as follows:

.. code-block::

    import mindspore.dataset.audio.transforms as audio

Descriptions of common data processing terms are as follows:

- TensorOperation, the base class of all data processing operations implemented in C++.
- AudioTensorOperation, the base class of all audio processing operations. It is a derived class of TensorOperation.

The data transform operation can be executed in the data processing pipeline or in the eager mode:

- Pipeline mode is generally used to process datasets. For examples, please refer to
  `introduction to data processing pipeline <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/r2.0/api_python/
  mindspore.dataset.html#introduction-to-data-processing-pipeline>`_ .
- Eager mode is generally used for scattered samples. Examples of audio preprocessing are as follows:

  .. code-block::

      import numpy as np
      import mindspore.dataset.audio as audio
      from mindspore.dataset.audio import ResampleMethod

      # audio sample
      waveform = np.random.random([1, 30])

      # transform
      resample_op = audio.Resample(orig_freq=48000, new_freq=16000,
                                   resample_method=ResampleMethod.SINC_INTERPOLATION,
                                   lowpass_filter_width=6, rolloff=0.99, beta=None)
      waveform_resampled = resample_op(waveform)
      print("waveform reampled: {}".format(waveform_resampled), flush=True)

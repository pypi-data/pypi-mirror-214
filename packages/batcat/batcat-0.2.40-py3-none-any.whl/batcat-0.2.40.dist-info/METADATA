BatCat is designed to help data scientists to practice machine learning operations (MLOps) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Services of AWS covered:
- AWS Lambda: a serverless, event-driven compute service
- AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service): provides object storage service
- Amazon Athena: a serverless, interactive query service on S3
- Amazon Redshift: a data warehouse product

Philosophy of BatCat's MLOps
============================

**BatCat** is designed to make the data scientist's life easier when practicing **machine learning operations (MLOps)** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

Services of AWS included:

1. **AWS Lambda**: a serverless, event-driven compute service
2. **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: provides object storage service
3. **AWS Glue**: is a serverless data integration service that makes data preparation simpler, faster, and cheaper. 
4. **Amazon Athena**: a serverless, interactive query service on S3
5. **Amazon Redshift**: a data warehouse product
6. **Amazon SageMaker Processing**: allows you to run steps for data pre- or post-processing, feature engineering, data validation, or model evaluation workloads on Amazon SageMaker.
7. **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, share, and deploy container images.
8. **AWS Step Functions**: a low-code, visual workflow service that developers use to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services.
9. **Secrets Manager**: is a secure and convenient storage system for API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data.

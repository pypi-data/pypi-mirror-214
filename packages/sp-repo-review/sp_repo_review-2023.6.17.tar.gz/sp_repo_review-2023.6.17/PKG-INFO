`sp-repo-review` provides checks based on the [Scientific-Python Development
Guide][] at [scientific-python/cookie][] for [repo-review][].

This tool can check the style of a repository. Use like this:

```bash
pipx run 'sp-repo-review[cli]' <path to repository>
```

This will produce a list of results - green checkmarks mean this rule is
followed, red x’s mean the rule is not. A yellow warning sign means that the
check was skipped because a previous required check failed. Some checks will
fail, that’s okay - the goal is bring all possible issues to your attention, not
to force compliance with arbitrary checks. Eventually there might be a way to
mark checks as ignored.

For example, `GH101` expects all your action files to have a nice `name:` field.
If you are happy with the file-based names you see in CI, you should feel free
to simply ignore this check (just visually ignore it for the moment, a way to
specify ignored checks will likely be added eventually).

All checks are mentioned at least in some way in the [Scientific-Python
Development Guide][]. You should read that first - if you are not attempting to
follow them, some of the checks might not work. For example, the guidelines
specify pytest configuration be placed in `pyproject.toml`. If you place it
somewhere else, then all the pytest checks will be skipped.

This was originally developed for [Scikit-HEP][] before moving to Scientific
Python.

You can also use GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- uses: scientific-python/cookie@<version>
```

Or pre-commit:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie
  rev: <version>
  hooks:
    - id: sp-repo-review
```

# ratingcurve
*A Python library for fitting hydrologic rating curves.*

In hydrology, a rating curve is a mathematical relationship between streamflow and water surface elevation (stage).
Because stage is much easier to measure than streamflow, almost all streamflow timeseries are generated from rating curves.
Historically, those ratings were fitted by hand, which can be time consuming and error prone.
`ratingcurve` provides an easy-to-use algorithm for fitting the standard form of rating curve, the segmented power law.

## Installation
Install using pip
```sh
pip install ratingcurve
```
or conda
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge ratingcurve
```

## Getting Started
This [`tutorial`](https://github.com/thodson-usgs/ratingcurve/blob/main/docs/notebooks/segmented-power-law-tutorial.ipynb)
notebook demonstrates basic usage of the package.
Try it locally or in Colab.
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thodson-usgs/ratingcurve/blob/main/docs/notebooks/segmented-power-law-tutorial.ipynb)

```python
from ratingcurve.ratingmodel import PowerLawRating
from ratingcurve import data

# load tutorial data
df = data.load('green channel')

# initialize the model
powerrating = PowerLawRating(q=df['q'],
                             h=df['stage'], 
                             q_sigma=df['q_sigma'],
                             segments=2)
                                   
# fit the model
trace = powerrating.fit()
powerrating.plot(trace)
```
![example plot](https://github.com/thodson-usgs/ratingcurve/blob/main/docs/assets/green-channel-rating-plot.png?raw=true)


Generate a rating table that can be imported into other applications.
```python
powerating.table(trace)
```

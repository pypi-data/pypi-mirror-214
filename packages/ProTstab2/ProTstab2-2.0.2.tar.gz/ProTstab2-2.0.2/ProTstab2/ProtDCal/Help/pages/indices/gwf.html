            <p> This parameter was developed by us as a measure of the free energy associated to the entropy of the water molecules attached to a particular residue. This entropy is estimated based in a pseudo-explicit representation of the water molecules coordinated to a particular polar residue. The entropy contribution comes from the possibility of interchanging the vibrational and rotational states among the water molecules grouped around the polar residue. The corresponding formalism results as:

            <p>Where <img src="../images/formula/nwx.png"/> means the number of water molecules associated to a polar residue,   <img src="../images/formula/sng.png"/> is a parameter that takes value one if a residue j if within 9.4Å of residue i and cero otherwise, <img src="../images/formula/dsj.png"/> takes value one if the residue is superficial (i.e. its accessible surface area is different than cero) and cero otherwise.

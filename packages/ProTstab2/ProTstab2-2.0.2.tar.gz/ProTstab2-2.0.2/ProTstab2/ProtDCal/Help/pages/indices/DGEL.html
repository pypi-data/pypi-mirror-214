            <p>Where qx are the electronic charge indices of each residue, rx represents the distances between the Ca of each residue and the center of the protein, rij means the distances between the Ca of each residue (residues with interaction distance lower than 4Å were not considered due to such local interaction are considered to be the same before and after the folding process) and  is the averaged radius of the protein. See <a href="param.html"> Table of index's parameters </a>for value of kel.

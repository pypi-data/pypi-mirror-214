        <h1>Defining new groups </h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            This option allows defining new groups that can be used to compute descriptors. These groups are created from residues ranges that can be specified using the panel "Ranges". To create new groups select the "Define new group ..." (<img src="images/groups_add.png"/>) option located in the menu "Options/Managing Groups" which will launch the following window:

        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="images/group.png"/>
            <p id="piefoto">Define new group window</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            In the panel "Group List" all groups are listed, also buttons (<img src="images/add24.png"/> ) and (<img src="images/remove24.png"/> ) can be used to add or delete them respectively. The right panel is composed by two sub-panels ( Description and Ranges ), on one side a description of the group selected is shown, while on the other the residues ranges list of the group can be configured using the (<img src="images/add24.png"/>) and (<img src="images/remove24.png"/>) buttons to add or delete the ranges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ranges can be configured in the range window, where "From" is the first residue in the range and "To" the last. Also this ranges can be defined between protein chains, where "A" is the fist chain. In addition many ranges can be configured and saved for a single group.

            To select the groups use the "Select groups ..." (<img src="images/groups_ok.png"/>) button located in the menu "Options/Managing groups" or "Other groups..." button in the Groups panel, both cases will launch the following window:

            <p> Some published indices like those listed ahead can be obtained from the previously described using other aggregation_operator procedure to transform the vector of residue indices to a single value for the protein or a particular group:
            </p>

            <h2> Long Range Order (LRO):</h2>

            <p>Long range order (LRO) is defined by the quotient between the total number of contacts of the protein and its whole number of residues (Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2001). 
            </p>
            <div class="dropshadow">
                <div class="innerbox">
                    <img src="../images/formula/LRO.jpg"/>			
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Where i and j are two residues whose Ca-Ca distance is less equal than 8Å and nr is the total number of residues in a protein.
                This descriptor can be calculated with ProtDCal averaging the number of contacts over the protein (using the aggregation_operator procedure arithmetic mean, Ar), using <img src="../images/formula/wij.png"/>	 . 

            </p>
            <p/>

            <h2> Absolute Contact Order (Abs_CO):</h2>

            <p>Absolute contact order (Abs_CO) was originally defined by Ivankov (Ivankov et al., 2003) as:
            </p>
            <div class="dropshadow">
                <div class="innerbox">
                    <img src="../images/formula/AbsCO.jpg"/>			
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>ProtDCal can estimates such descriptor as the summation (the aggregation_operator procedure N1, distance 1 of Minkosky) of the weighted residue-wise relative contact order for each residue of the protein, using <img src="../images/formula/wij.png"/>.
            </p>
            <p/>

            <h2>Total Contact Distance (TCD):</h2>

            <p>The total contact distance was originally defined as:
            </p>
            <div class="dropshadow">
                <div class="innerbox">
                    <img src="../images/formula/TCD.jpg"/>			
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>where nr is the number of amino acid residues of a protein, nc is the number of contacts (Zhou and Zhou, 2002).
                The original global TCD can be obtained averaging (using the aggregation_operator procedure arithmetic mean, Ar) all the obtained residue-wise values using <img src="../images/formula/wij.png"/>.
            </p>

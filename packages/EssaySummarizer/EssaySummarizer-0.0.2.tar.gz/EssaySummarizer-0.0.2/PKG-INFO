## Discription
EssaySummarizer is a powerful and user-friendly Python package designed to facilitate the summarization of large essays or text documents. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, EssaySummarizer aims to condense lengthy texts while ensuring grammatical correctness. The package utilizes the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, which provides a wide range of NLP functionalities. It leverages techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, and sentence scoring to extract the most relevant information from the essay.

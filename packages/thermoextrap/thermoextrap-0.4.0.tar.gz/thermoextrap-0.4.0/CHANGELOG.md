<!-- scriv-insert-here -->

## v0.4.0 — 2023-06-15

### Added

- Package now available on conda-forge

- Now support python3.11
- Bumped pymbar version to pymbar>=4.0

### Changed

- Switched from tox to nox for testing.

### Deprecated

- No longer support pymbar < 4.0

## v0.3.0 — 2023-05-03

### Changed

- New linters via pre-commit
- Development env now handled by tox

- Moved `modesl, data, idealgas` from `thermoextrap.core` to `thermoextrap`.
  These were imported at top level anyway. This fixes issues with doing things
  like `from thermoextrap.data import ...`, etc.
- Moved `core._docstrings_` to `docstrings`.
- Now using `cmomy.docstrings` instead of repeating them here.

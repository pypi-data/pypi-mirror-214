# Lord of the Rings SDK

```
Hello LibLab!

I hope you're doing well, my friend! My name is Emmanuel, and I'm thrilled to be participating in this test to become your new DevOps Engineer. I absolutely love challenges like this, and I'm always excited to give my best shot. Unfortunately, with the limited time of 6 hours, I couldn't take care of every detail as I usually do, such as complete unit testing, improving folder structure, and validating most parameters. However, I believe this test showcases my understanding of Python and SDKs.

If you're curious to see more, feel free to check out other projects on my GitHub and my LinkedIn page, where you can explore my journey so far (links are provided below)!
Best,
See ya soon!

## Introduction

CSSegmentation: An Open Source Continual Semantic Segmentation Toolbox Based on PyTorch.
You can star this repository to keep track of the project if it's helpful for you, thank you for your support.


## Major Features

- **High Performance**

  The performance of re-implemented CSS algorithms is better than or comparable to the original paper.
 
- **Modular Design and Unified Benchmark**
  
  Various CSS methods are unified into several specific modules.
  Benefiting from this design, CSSegmentation can integrate a great deal of popular and contemporary continual semantic segmentation frameworks and then, train and test them on unified benchmarks.
  
- **Fewer Dependencies**

  CSSegmentation tries its best to avoid introducing more dependencies when reproducing novel continual semantic segmentation approaches.

; This patch fixes the unused chance in dungeon properties, restoring its original functionality. If the chance passes, one of the rooms in the current
; floor will be turned into a maze made up of walls.

; This file is intended to be used with armips v0.11
; Required ROM: Explorers of Sky (EU/US)
; Required files: overlay_0029.bin

; Mark rooms where a wall maze has been generated as inelegible for secondary terrain generation. This stops the game from generating both a maze and water/lava lakes,
; which can make some tiles unreachable, potentially softlocking the player if the stairs happen to be there.

	; This overwrites the loop's break instruction, but it doesn't matter because only a maximum of one room is chosen to spawn a maze every floor
	; Another instruction could be fit in here by removing the branch at EU_2341000 and using conditional suffixes instead

Now alpha support for prokaryotes too!

<br /><br />

# NOTE
While extensive alpha testing has been conducted, this software is in a beta state, and errors are expected. Kindly report these issues and remain patient for fixes - if you can find the bug, even better! This software will have longterm maintenance, although my focus is on my own research.

Cheers,
Zachary Konkel

# PURPOSE
Bring broadscale comparative genomics to the masses. 

Mycotools is a compilation of computational biology tools and database [MycotoolsDB](https://gitlab.com/xonq/mycotools/-/blob/master/mycotools/MTDB.md) software that facilitate large-scale prokaryote and fungal comparative genomics. MycotoolsDB locally assimilates all NCBI and MycoCosm (Joint Genome Institute) genomes into a database schema with uniform file curation, scalability, and automation as guiding principles. 

- Installation is as simple as `updateDB.py --init <DIR>`. No more limited and
  incomplete databases.
- `updateDB.py --update` brings the database to the current date. No more
  database obsolecence in the wake of accelerating genome availability.
- The MycotoolsDB (MTDB) uniformly curates the numerous notorious iterations of
  the `gff`, allowing for reliable analyses and format expectations from
  multiple eras.
- The `.mtdb` database format enables swift transitions from analyses with datasets of 100,000s genomes to as few as a lineage of interest. No more scrambling to acquire files for an analysis.

Mycotools is currently available as a beta subset of the full suite, excluding the database assimilation tools. MycotoolsDB is currently restricted to Ohio Supercomputer Center - if you are interested in early access, please email `konkelzach@protonmail.com`.

<br />

By integrating with the curated MycotoolsDB, Mycotools aids routine-complex tasks like retrieving `gff` or `fasta` accessions; running and compiling `fasta`s of MycotoolsDB BLAST/hmmsearches; biology-based database manipulation tools; automated phylogenetic analysis pipelines from blast to Pfam extraction to tree prediction, etc etc. Mycotools includes sets of utilities that also enable easy acquisition of batches of sequence data using `ncbiDwnld.py` and `jgiDwnld.py`.

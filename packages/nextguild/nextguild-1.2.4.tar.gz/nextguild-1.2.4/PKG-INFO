# About

NextGuild is a Guilded API wrapper written in Python.

Planning on being the most simplest python library interacting with the Guilded API, Nextguild is planning to be beginner-friendly and be a great resource to learn Python programming, this is a library, with easy configuration.

Made from a team of 2 people, this was a simple project originally thought for a fun purpose and for testing the Guilded API, which eventually turned into a bot library for multi-purpose use.

## Installation

Use the Python Package Index package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install NextGuild to start using this package for your project.

# Triggers

Triggers allows you to execute code during deployments. This can be used for a
variety of use cases such as:

* Self tests: validate something after a resource/construct been provisioned
* Data priming: add initial data to resources after they are created
* Preconditions: check things such as account limits or external dependencies
  before deployment.

## Usage

The `TriggerFunction` construct will define an AWS Lambda function which is
triggered *during* deployment:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
import monocdk as lambda_
import monocdk as triggers
from monocdk import Stack

# stack: Stack


triggers.TriggerFunction(stack, "MyTrigger",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(__dirname + "/my-trigger")
)
```

In the above example, the AWS Lambda function defined in `myLambdaFunction` will
be invoked when the stack is deployed.

## Trigger Failures

If the trigger handler fails (e.g. an exception is raised), the CloudFormation
deployment will fail, as if a resource failed to provision. This makes it easy
to implement "self tests" via triggers by simply making a set of assertions on
some provisioned infrastructure.

## Order of Execution

By default, a trigger will be executed by CloudFormation after the associated
handler is provisioned. This means that if the handler takes an implicit
dependency on other resources (e.g. via environment variables), those resources
will be provisioned *before* the trigger is executed.

In most cases, implicit ordering should be sufficient, but you can also use
`executeAfter` and `executeBefore` to control the order of execution.

The following example defines the following order: `(hello, world) => myTrigger => goodbye`.
The resources under `hello` and `world` will be provisioned in
parallel, and then the trigger `myTrigger` will be executed. Only then the
resources under `goodbye` will be provisioned:

```python
# Example automatically generated from non-compiling source. May contain errors.
from constructs import Construct, Node
import monocdk as triggers

# my_trigger: triggers.Trigger
# hello: Construct
# world: Construct
# goodbye: Construct


my_trigger.execute_after(hello, world)
my_trigger.execute_before(goodbye)
```

Note that `hello` and `world` are construct *scopes*. This means that they can
be specific resources (such as an `s3.Bucket` object) or groups of resources
composed together into constructs.

## Re-execution of Triggers

By default, `executeOnHandlerChange` is enabled. This implies that the trigger
is re-executed every time the handler function code or configuration changes. If
this option is disabled, the trigger will be executed only once upon first
deployment.

In the future we will consider adding support for additional re-execution modes:

* `executeOnEveryDeployment: boolean` - re-executes every time the stack is
  deployed (add random "salt" during synthesis).
* `executeOnResourceChange: Construct[]` - re-executes when one of the resources
  under the specified scopes has changed (add the hash the CloudFormation
  resource specs).

It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-features.html#gettingstarted-features-programmingmodel. Use ``Handler.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image. NOTE: If you specify your source code as inline text by specifying the ZipFile property within the Code property, specify index.function_name as the handler.
        :param runtime: (experimental) The runtime environment for the Lambda function that you are uploading. For valid values, see the Runtime property in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Use ``Runtime.FROM_IMAGE`` when when defining a function from a Docker image.

        :param allow_all_outbound: (experimental) Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: (experimental) Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param architecture: (experimental) The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param architectures: (deprecated) DEPRECATED. Default: [Architecture.X86_64]
        :param code_signing_config: (experimental) Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: (experimental) Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: (experimental) The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: (experimental) Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: (experimental) The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: (experimental) A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: (experimental) Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: (experimental) The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: (experimental) The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: (experimental) Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: (experimental) The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: (experimental) A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: (experimental) Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: (experimental) Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param layers: (experimental) A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: (experimental) When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: (experimental) The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: (experimental) The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param profiling: (experimental) Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: (experimental) Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: (experimental) The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: (experimental) Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param security_group: (deprecated) What security group to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. This property is being deprecated, consider using securityGroups instead. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Use securityGroups property instead. Function constructor will throw an error if both are specified. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroups prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param timeout: (experimental) The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: (experimental) Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Note: internet access for Lambdas requires a NAT gateway, so picking Public subnets is not allowed. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: (experimental) The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: (experimental) The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: (experimental) The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: (experimental) The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2

        '''(experimental) Props for ``InvokeFunction``.

        :param max_event_age: (experimental) The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: (experimental) The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: (experimental) The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination

        :param allow_all_outbound: (experimental) Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: (experimental) Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param architecture: (experimental) The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param architectures: (deprecated) DEPRECATED. Default: [Architecture.X86_64]
        :param code_signing_config: (experimental) Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: (experimental) Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: (experimental) The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: (experimental) Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: (experimental) The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: (experimental) A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: (experimental) Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: (experimental) The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: (experimental) The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: (experimental) Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: (experimental) The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: (experimental) A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: (experimental) Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: (experimental) Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param layers: (experimental) A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_retention: (experimental) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: (experimental) When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: (experimental) The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: (experimental) The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param profiling: (experimental) Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: (experimental) Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: (experimental) The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: (experimental) Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param security_group: (deprecated) What security group to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. This property is being deprecated, consider using securityGroups instead. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Use securityGroups property instead. Function constructor will throw an error if both are specified. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroups prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param security_groups: (experimental) The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param timeout: (experimental) The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: (experimental) Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: (experimental) VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: (experimental) Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Note: internet access for Lambdas requires a NAT gateway, so picking Public subnets is not allowed. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param code: (experimental) The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.
        :param handler: (experimental) The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your function. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-features.html#gettingstarted-features-programmingmodel. Use ``Handler.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image. NOTE: If you specify your source code as inline text by specifying the ZipFile property within the Code property, specify index.function_name as the handler.
        :param runtime: (experimental) The runtime environment for the Lambda function that you are uploading. For valid values, see the Runtime property in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Use ``Runtime.FROM_IMAGE`` when when defining a function from a Docker image.
        :param execute_after: (experimental) Adds trigger dependencies. Execute this trigger only after these construct scopes have been provisioned. You can also use ``trigger.executeAfter()`` to add additional dependencies. Default: []
        :param execute_before: (experimental) Adds this trigger as a dependency on other constructs. This means that this trigger will get executed *before* the given construct(s). You can also use ``trigger.executeBefore()`` to add additional dependants. Default: []
        :param execute_on_handler_change: (experimental) Re-executes the trigger every time the handler changes. This implies that the trigger is associated with the ``currentVersion`` of the handler, which gets recreated every time the handler or its configuration is updated. Default: true

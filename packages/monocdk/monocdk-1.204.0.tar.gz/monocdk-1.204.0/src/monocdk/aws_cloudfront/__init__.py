# Amazon CloudFront Construct Library

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to
your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that
you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency, so that content is delivered with the best
possible performance.

## Distribution API

The `Distribution` API is currently being built to replace the existing `CloudFrontWebDistribution` API. The `Distribution` API is optimized for the
most common use cases of CloudFront distributions (e.g., single origin and behavior, few customizations) while still providing the ability for more
advanced use cases. The API focuses on simplicity for the common use cases, and convenience methods for creating the behaviors and origins necessary
for more complex use cases.

### Creating a distribution

CloudFront distributions deliver your content from one or more origins; an origin is the location where you store the original version of your
content. Origins can be created from S3 buckets or a custom origin (HTTP server). Constructs to define origins are in the `@aws-cdk/aws-cloudfront-origins` module.

Each distribution has a default behavior which applies to all requests to that distribution, and routes requests to a primary origin.
Additional behaviors may be specified for an origin with a given URL path pattern. Behaviors allow routing with multiple origins,
controlling which HTTP methods to support, whether to require users to use HTTPS, and what query strings or cookies to forward to your origin,
among other settings.

#### From an S3 Bucket

An S3 bucket can be added as an origin. If the bucket is configured as a website endpoint, the distribution can use S3 redirects and S3 custom error
documents.

```python
# Creates a distribution from an S3 bucket.
my_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "myBucket")
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=origins.S3Origin(my_bucket))
)
```

The above will treat the bucket differently based on if `IBucket.isWebsite` is set or not. If the bucket is configured as a website, the bucket is
treated as an HTTP origin, and the built-in S3 redirects and error pages can be used. Otherwise, the bucket is handled as a bucket origin and
CloudFront's redirect and error handling will be used. In the latter case, the Origin will create an origin access identity and grant it access to the
underlying bucket. This can be used in conjunction with a bucket that is not public to require that your users access your content using CloudFront
URLs and not S3 URLs directly.

#### ELBv2 Load Balancer

An Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) v2 load balancer may be used as an origin. In order for a load balancer to serve as an origin, it must be publicly
accessible (`internetFacing` is true). Both Application and Network load balancers are supported.

```python
# Creates a distribution from an ELBv2 load balancer
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

# Create an application load balancer in a VPC. 'internetFacing' must be 'true'
# for CloudFront to access the load balancer and use it as an origin.
lb = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(self, "LB",
    vpc=vpc,
    internet_facing=True
)
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=origins.LoadBalancerV2Origin(lb))
)
```

#### From an HTTP endpoint

Origins can also be created from any other HTTP endpoint, given the domain name, and optionally, other origin properties.

```python
# Creates a distribution from an HTTP endpoint
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=origins.HttpOrigin("www.example.com"))
)
```

### Domain Names and Certificates

When you create a distribution, CloudFront assigns a domain name for the distribution, for example: `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`; this value can
be retrieved from `distribution.distributionDomainName`. CloudFront distributions use a default certificate (`*.cloudfront.net`) to support HTTPS by
default. If you want to use your own domain name, such as `www.example.com`, you must associate a certificate with your distribution that contains
your domain name, and provide one (or more) domain names from the certificate for the distribution.

The certificate must be present in the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service in the US East (N. Virginia) region; the certificate
may either be created by ACM, or created elsewhere and imported into ACM. When a certificate is used, the distribution will support HTTPS connections
from SNI only and a minimum protocol version of TLSv1.2_2021 if the `@aws-cdk/aws-cloudfront:defaultSecurityPolicyTLSv1.2_2021` feature flag is set, and TLSv1.2_2019 otherwise.

```python
# To use your own domain name in a Distribution, you must associate a certificate
import monocdk as acm
import monocdk as route53

# hosted_zone: route53.HostedZone

# my_bucket: s3.Bucket

my_certificate = acm.DnsValidatedCertificate(self, "mySiteCert",
    domain_name="www.example.com",
    hosted_zone=hosted_zone
)
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=acm.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=origins.S3Origin(my_bucket)),
    domain_names=["www.example.com"],
    certificate=my_certificate
)
```

However, you can customize the minimum protocol version for the certificate while creating the distribution using `minimumProtocolVersion` property.

```python
# Create a Distribution with a custom domain name and a minimum protocol version.
# my_bucket: s3.Bucket

cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=origins.S3Origin(my_bucket)),
    domain_names=["www.example.com"],
    minimum_protocol_version=cloudfront.SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_2016,
    ssl_support_method=cloudfront.SSLMethod.SNI
)
```

### Multiple Behaviors & Origins

Each distribution has a default behavior which applies to all requests to that distribution; additional behaviors may be specified for a
given URL path pattern. Behaviors allow routing with multiple origins, controlling which HTTP methods to support, whether to require users to
use HTTPS, and what query strings or cookies to forward to your origin, among others.

The properties of the default behavior can be adjusted as part of the distribution creation. The following example shows configuring the HTTP
methods and viewer protocol policy of the cache.

```python
# Create a Distribution with configured HTTP methods and viewer protocol policy of the cache.
# my_bucket: s3.Bucket

my_web_distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(my_bucket),
        allowed_methods=cloudfront.AllowedMethods.ALLOW_ALL,
        viewer_protocol_policy=cloudfront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS
    )
)
```

Additional behaviors can be specified at creation, or added after the initial creation. Each additional behavior is associated with an origin,
and enable customization for a specific set of resources based on a URL path pattern. For example, we can add a behavior to `myWebDistribution` to
override the default viewer protocol policy for all of the images.

```python
# Add a behavior to a Distribution after initial creation.
# my_bucket: s3.Bucket
# my_web_distribution: cloudfront.Distribution

my_web_distribution.add_behavior("/images/*.jpg", origins.S3Origin(my_bucket),
    viewer_protocol_policy=cloudfront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS
)
```

These behaviors can also be specified at distribution creation time.

```python
# Create a Distribution with additional behaviors at creation time.
# my_bucket: s3.Bucket

bucket_origin = origins.S3Origin(my_bucket)
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=bucket_origin,
        allowed_methods=cloudfront.AllowedMethods.ALLOW_ALL,
        viewer_protocol_policy=cloudfront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS
    ),
    additional_behaviors={
        "/images/*.jpg": cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
            origin=bucket_origin,
            viewer_protocol_policy=cloudfront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS
        )
    }
)
```

### Customizing Cache Keys and TTLs with Cache Policies

You can use a cache policy to improve your cache hit ratio by controlling the values (URL query strings, HTTP headers, and cookies)
that are included in the cache key, and/or adjusting how long items remain in the cache via the time-to-live (TTL) settings.
CloudFront provides some predefined cache policies, known as managed policies, for common use cases. You can use these managed policies,
or you can create your own cache policy that’s specific to your needs.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html for more details.

```python
# Using an existing cache policy for a Distribution
# bucket_origin: origins.S3Origin

cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDistManagedPolicy",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=bucket_origin,
        cache_policy=cloudfront.CachePolicy.CACHING_OPTIMIZED
    )
)
```

```python
# Creating a custom cache policy for a Distribution -- all parameters optional
# bucket_origin: origins.S3Origin

my_cache_policy = cloudfront.CachePolicy(self, "myCachePolicy",
    cache_policy_name="MyPolicy",
    comment="A default policy",
    default_ttl=Duration.days(2),
    min_ttl=Duration.minutes(1),
    max_ttl=Duration.days(10),
    cookie_behavior=cloudfront.CacheCookieBehavior.all(),
    header_behavior=cloudfront.CacheHeaderBehavior.allow_list("X-CustomHeader"),
    query_string_behavior=cloudfront.CacheQueryStringBehavior.deny_list("username"),
    enable_accept_encoding_gzip=True,
    enable_accept_encoding_brotli=True
)
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDistCustomPolicy",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=bucket_origin,
        cache_policy=my_cache_policy
    )
)
```

### Customizing Origin Requests with Origin Request Policies

When CloudFront makes a request to an origin, the URL path, request body (if present), and a few standard headers are included.
Other information from the viewer request, such as URL query strings, HTTP headers, and cookies, is not included in the origin request by default.
You can use an origin request policy to control the information that’s included in an origin request.
CloudFront provides some predefined origin request policies, known as managed policies, for common use cases. You can use these managed policies,
or you can create your own origin request policy that’s specific to your needs.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html for more details.

```python
# Using an existing origin request policy for a Distribution
# bucket_origin: origins.S3Origin

cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDistManagedPolicy",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=bucket_origin,
        origin_request_policy=cloudfront.OriginRequestPolicy.CORS_S3_ORIGIN
    )
)
```

```python
# Creating a custom origin request policy for a Distribution -- all parameters optional
# bucket_origin: origins.S3Origin

my_origin_request_policy = cloudfront.OriginRequestPolicy(self, "OriginRequestPolicy",
    origin_request_policy_name="MyPolicy",
    comment="A default policy",
    cookie_behavior=cloudfront.OriginRequestCookieBehavior.none(),
    header_behavior=cloudfront.OriginRequestHeaderBehavior.all("CloudFront-Is-Android-Viewer"),
    query_string_behavior=cloudfront.OriginRequestQueryStringBehavior.allow_list("username")
)

cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDistCustomPolicy",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=bucket_origin,
        origin_request_policy=my_origin_request_policy
    )
)
```

### Customizing Response Headers with Response Headers Policies

You can configure CloudFront to add one or more HTTP headers to the responses that it sends to viewers (web browsers or other clients), without making any changes to the origin or writing any code.
To specify the headers that CloudFront adds to HTTP responses, you use a response headers policy. CloudFront adds the headers regardless of whether it serves the object from the cache or has to retrieve the object from the origin. If the origin response includes one or more of the headers that’s in a response headers policy, the policy can specify whether CloudFront uses the header it received from the origin or overwrites it with the one in the policy.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/adding-response-headers.html

```python
# Using an existing managed response headers policy
# bucket_origin: origins.S3Origin

cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDistManagedPolicy",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=bucket_origin,
        response_headers_policy=cloudfront.ResponseHeadersPolicy.CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS
    )
)

# Creating a custom response headers policy -- all parameters optional
my_response_headers_policy = cloudfront.ResponseHeadersPolicy(self, "ResponseHeadersPolicy",
    response_headers_policy_name="MyPolicy",
    comment="A default policy",
    cors_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersCorsBehavior(
        access_control_allow_credentials=False,
        access_control_allow_headers=["X-Custom-Header-1", "X-Custom-Header-2"],
        access_control_allow_methods=["GET", "POST"],
        access_control_allow_origins=["*"],
        access_control_expose_headers=["X-Custom-Header-1", "X-Custom-Header-2"],
        access_control_max_age=Duration.seconds(600),
        origin_override=True
    ),
    custom_headers_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseCustomHeadersBehavior(
        custom_headers=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseCustomHeader(header="X-Amz-Date", value="some-value", override=True), cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseCustomHeader(header="X-Amz-Security-Token", value="some-value", override=False)
        ]
    ),
    security_headers_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseSecurityHeadersBehavior(
        content_security_policy=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersContentSecurityPolicy(content_security_policy="default-src https:;", override=True),
        content_type_options=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersContentTypeOptions(override=True),
        frame_options=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersFrameOptions(frame_option=cloudfront.HeadersFrameOption.DENY, override=True),
        referrer_policy=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersReferrerPolicy(referrer_policy=cloudfront.HeadersReferrerPolicy.NO_REFERRER, override=True),
        strict_transport_security=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersStrictTransportSecurity(access_control_max_age=Duration.seconds(600), include_subdomains=True, override=True),
        xss_protection=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.ResponseHeadersXSSProtection(protection=True, mode_block=True, report_uri="https://example.com/csp-report", override=True)
    )
)
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDistCustomPolicy",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=bucket_origin,
        response_headers_policy=my_response_headers_policy
    )
)
```

### Validating signed URLs or signed cookies with Trusted Key Groups

CloudFront Distribution supports validating signed URLs or signed cookies using key groups.
When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed
cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior.

```python
# Validating signed URLs or signed cookies with Trusted Key Groups

# public key in PEM format
# public_key: str

pub_key = cloudfront.PublicKey(self, "MyPubKey",
    encoded_key=public_key
)

key_group = cloudfront.KeyGroup(self, "MyKeyGroup",
    items=[pub_key
    ]
)

cloudfront.Distribution(self, "Dist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.HttpOrigin("www.example.com"),
        trusted_key_groups=[key_group
        ]
    )
)
```

### Lambda@Edge

Lambda@Edge is an extension of AWS Lambda, a compute service that lets you execute
functions that customize the content that CloudFront delivers. You can author Node.js
or Python functions in the US East (N. Virginia) region, and then execute them in AWS
locations globally that are closer to the viewer, without provisioning or managing servers.
Lambda@Edge functions are associated with a specific behavior and event type. Lambda@Edge
can be used to rewrite URLs, alter responses based on headers or cookies, or authorize
requests based on headers or authorization tokens.

The following shows a Lambda@Edge function added to the default behavior and triggered
on every request:

```python
# my_bucket: s3.Bucket
# A Lambda@Edge function added to default behavior of a Distribution
# and triggered on every request
my_func = cloudfront.experimental.EdgeFunction(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(my_bucket),
        edge_lambdas=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.EdgeLambda(
            function_version=my_func.current_version,
            event_type=cloudfront.LambdaEdgeEventType.VIEWER_REQUEST
        )
        ]
    )
)
```

> **Note:** Lambda@Edge functions must be created in the `us-east-1` region, regardless of the region of the CloudFront distribution and stack.
> To make it easier to request functions for Lambda@Edge, the `EdgeFunction` construct can be used.
> The `EdgeFunction` construct will automatically request a function in `us-east-1`, regardless of the region of the current stack.
> `EdgeFunction` has the same interface as `Function` and can be created and used interchangeably.
> Please note that using `EdgeFunction` requires that the `us-east-1` region has been bootstrapped.
> See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html for more about bootstrapping regions.

If the stack is in `us-east-1`, a "normal" `lambda.Function` can be used instead of an `EdgeFunction`.

```python
# Using a lambda Function instead of an EdgeFunction for stacks in `us-east-`.
my_func = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)
```

If the stack is not in `us-east-1`, and you need references from different applications on the same account,
you can also set a specific stack ID for each Lambda@Edge.

```python
# Setting stackIds for EdgeFunctions that can be referenced from different applications
# on the same account.
my_func1 = cloudfront.experimental.EdgeFunction(self, "MyFunction1",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler1")),
    stack_id="edge-lambda-stack-id-1"
)

my_func2 = cloudfront.experimental.EdgeFunction(self, "MyFunction2",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler2")),
    stack_id="edge-lambda-stack-id-2"
)
```

Lambda@Edge functions can also be associated with additional behaviors,
either at or after Distribution creation time.

```python
# Associating a Lambda@Edge function with additional behaviors.

# my_func: cloudfront.experimental.EdgeFunction
# assigning at Distribution creation
# my_bucket: s3.Bucket

my_origin = origins.S3Origin(my_bucket)
my_distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=my_origin),
    additional_behaviors={
        "images/*": cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
            origin=my_origin,
            edge_lambdas=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.EdgeLambda(
                function_version=my_func.current_version,
                event_type=cloudfront.LambdaEdgeEventType.ORIGIN_REQUEST,
                include_body=True
            )
            ]
        )
    }
)

# assigning after creation
my_distribution.add_behavior("images/*", my_origin,
    edge_lambdas=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.EdgeLambda(
        function_version=my_func.current_version,
        event_type=cloudfront.LambdaEdgeEventType.VIEWER_RESPONSE
    )
    ]
)
```

Adding an existing Lambda@Edge function created in a different stack to a CloudFront distribution.

```python
# Adding an existing Lambda@Edge function created in a different stack
# to a CloudFront distribution.
# s3_bucket: s3.Bucket

function_version = lambda_.Version.from_version_arn(self, "Version", "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:functionName:1")

cloudfront.Distribution(self, "distro",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(s3_bucket),
        edge_lambdas=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.EdgeLambda(
            function_version=function_version,
            event_type=cloudfront.LambdaEdgeEventType.VIEWER_REQUEST
        )
        ]
    )
)
```

### CloudFront Function

You can also deploy CloudFront functions and add them to a CloudFront distribution.

```python
# s3_bucket: s3.Bucket
# Add a cloudfront Function to a Distribution
cf_function = cloudfront.Function(self, "Function",
    code=cloudfront.FunctionCode.from_inline("function handler(event) { return event.request }")
)
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "distro",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(s3_bucket),
        function_associations=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.FunctionAssociation(
            function=cf_function,
            event_type=cloudfront.FunctionEventType.VIEWER_REQUEST
        )]
    )
)
```

It will auto-generate the name of the function and deploy it to the `live` stage.

Additionally, you can load the function's code from a file using the `FunctionCode.fromFile()` method.

### Logging

You can configure CloudFront to create log files that contain detailed information about every user request that CloudFront receives.
The logs can go to either an existing bucket, or a bucket will be created for you.

```python
# Configure logging for Distributions

# Simplest form - creates a new bucket and logs to it.
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=origins.HttpOrigin("www.example.com")),
    enable_logging=True
)

# You can optionally log to a specific bucket, configure whether cookies are logged, and give the log files a prefix.
cloudfront.Distribution(self, "myDist",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(origin=origins.HttpOrigin("www.example.com")),
    enable_logging=True,  # Optional, this is implied if logBucket is specified
    log_bucket=s3.Bucket(self, "LogBucket"),
    log_file_prefix="distribution-access-logs/",
    log_includes_cookies=True
)
```

### Importing Distributions

Existing distributions can be imported as well; note that like most imported constructs, an imported distribution cannot be modified.
However, it can be used as a reference for other higher-level constructs.

```python
# Using a reference to an imported Distribution
distribution = cloudfront.Distribution.from_distribution_attributes(self, "ImportedDist",
    domain_name="d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net",
    distribution_id="012345ABCDEF"
)
```

## Migrating from the original CloudFrontWebDistribution to the newer Distribution construct

It's possible to migrate a distribution from the original to the modern API.
The changes necessary are the following:

### The Distribution

Replace `new CloudFrontWebDistribution` with `new Distribution`. Some
configuration properties have been changed:

| Old API                        | New API                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `originConfigs`                | `defaultBehavior`; use `additionalBehaviors` if necessary                                      |
| `viewerCertificate`            | `certificate`; use `domainNames` for aliases                                                   |
| `errorConfigurations`          | `errorResponses`                                                                               |
| `loggingConfig`                | `enableLogging`; configure with `logBucket` `logFilePrefix` and `logIncludesCookies`           |
| `viewerProtocolPolicy`         | removed; set on each behavior instead. default changed from `REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS` to `ALLOW_ALL` |

After switching constructs, you need to maintain the same logical ID for the underlying [CfnDistribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-cloudfront.CfnDistribution.html) if you wish to avoid the deletion and recreation of your distribution.
To do this, use [escape hatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cfn_layer.html) to override the logical ID created by the new Distribution construct with the logical ID created by the old construct.

Example:

```python
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket


my_distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(source_bucket)
    )
)
cfn_distribution = my_distribution.node.default_child
cfn_distribution.override_logical_id("MyDistributionCFDistribution3H55TI9Q")
```

### Behaviors

The modern API makes use of the [CloudFront Origins](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cloudfront_origins-readme.html) module to easily configure your origin. Replace your origin configuration with the relevant CloudFront Origins class. For example, here's a behavior with an S3 origin:

```python
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket
# oai: cloudfront.OriginAccessIdentity


cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=source_bucket,
            origin_access_identity=oai
        ),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )
    ]
)
```

Becomes:

```python
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket


distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(source_bucket)
    )
)
```

In the original API all behaviors are defined in the `originConfigs` property. The new API is optimized for a single origin and behavior, so the default behavior and additional behaviors will be defined separately.

```python
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket
# oai: cloudfront.OriginAccessIdentity


cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=source_bucket,
            origin_access_identity=oai
        ),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    ), cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        custom_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.CustomOriginConfig(
            domain_name="MYALIAS"
        ),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(path_pattern="/somewhere")]
    )
    ]
)
```

Becomes:

```python
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket


distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(source_bucket)
    ),
    additional_behaviors={
        "/somewhere": cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
            origin=origins.HttpOrigin("MYALIAS")
        )
    }
)
```

### Certificates

If you are using an ACM certificate, you can pass the certificate directly to the `certificate` prop.
Any aliases used before in the `ViewerCertificate` class should be passed in to the `domainNames` prop in the modern API.

```python
import monocdk as acm
# certificate: acm.Certificate
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket


viewer_certificate = cloudfront.ViewerCertificate.from_acm_certificate(certificate,
    aliases=["MYALIAS"]
)

cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    origin_configs=[acm.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=acm.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=source_bucket
        ),
        behaviors=[acm.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )
    ],
    viewer_certificate=viewer_certificate
)
```

Becomes:

```python
import monocdk as acm
# certificate: acm.Certificate
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket


distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    default_behavior=acm.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(source_bucket)
    ),
    domain_names=["MYALIAS"],
    certificate=certificate
)
```

IAM certificates aren't directly supported by the new API, but can be easily configured through [escape hatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cfn_layer.html)

```python
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket

viewer_certificate = cloudfront.ViewerCertificate.from_iam_certificate("MYIAMROLEIDENTIFIER",
    aliases=["MYALIAS"]
)

cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=source_bucket
        ),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )
    ],
    viewer_certificate=viewer_certificate
)
```

Becomes:

```python
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket

distribution = cloudfront.Distribution(self, "MyCfWebDistribution",
    default_behavior=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.BehaviorOptions(
        origin=origins.S3Origin(source_bucket)
    ),
    domain_names=["MYALIAS"]
)

cfn_distribution = distribution.node.default_child

cfn_distribution.add_property_override("ViewerCertificate.IamCertificateId", "MYIAMROLEIDENTIFIER")
cfn_distribution.add_property_override("ViewerCertificate.SslSupportMethod", "sni-only")
```

### Other changes

A number of default settings have changed on the new API when creating a new distribution, behavior, and origin.
After making the major changes needed for the migration, run `cdk diff` to see what settings have changed.
If no changes are desired during migration, you will at the least be able to use [escape hatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cfn_layer.html) to override what the CDK synthesizes, if you can't change the properties directly.

## CloudFrontWebDistribution API

> The `CloudFrontWebDistribution` construct is the original construct written for working with CloudFront distributions.
> Users are encouraged to use the newer `Distribution` instead, as it has a simpler interface and receives new features faster.

Example usage:

```python
# Using a CloudFrontWebDistribution construct.

# source_bucket: s3.Bucket

distribution = cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "MyDistribution",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=source_bucket
        ),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )
    ]
)
```

### Viewer certificate

By default, CloudFront Web Distributions will answer HTTPS requests with CloudFront's default certificate,
only containing the distribution `domainName` (e.g. d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net).
You can customize the viewer certificate property to provide a custom certificate and/or list of domain name aliases to fit your needs.

See [Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-alternate-domain-names.html) in the CloudFront User Guide.

#### Default certificate

You can customize the default certificate aliases. This is intended to be used in combination with CNAME records in your DNS zone.

Example:

```python
s3_bucket_source = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket")

distribution = cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "AnAmazingWebsiteProbably",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(s3_bucket_source=s3_bucket_source),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )],
    viewer_certificate=cloudfront.ViewerCertificate.from_cloud_front_default_certificate("www.example.com")
)
```

#### ACM certificate

You can change the default certificate by one stored AWS Certificate Manager, or ACM.
Those certificate can either be generated by AWS, or purchased by another CA imported into ACM.

For more information, see
[the aws-certificatemanager module documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-certificatemanager-readme.html)
or [Importing Certificates into AWS Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html)
in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

Example:

```python
s3_bucket_source = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket")

certificate = certificatemanager.Certificate(self, "Certificate",
    domain_name="example.com",
    subject_alternative_names=["*.example.com"]
)

distribution = cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "AnAmazingWebsiteProbably",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(s3_bucket_source=s3_bucket_source),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )],
    viewer_certificate=cloudfront.ViewerCertificate.from_acm_certificate(certificate,
        aliases=["example.com", "www.example.com"],
        security_policy=cloudfront.SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1,  # default
        ssl_method=cloudfront.SSLMethod.SNI
    )
)
```

#### IAM certificate

You can also import a certificate into the IAM certificate store.

See [Importing an SSL/TLS Certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-procedures.html#cnames-and-https-uploading-certificates) in the CloudFront User Guide.

Example:

```python
s3_bucket_source = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket")

distribution = cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "AnAmazingWebsiteProbably",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(s3_bucket_source=s3_bucket_source),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )],
    viewer_certificate=cloudfront.ViewerCertificate.from_iam_certificate("certificateId",
        aliases=["example.com"],
        security_policy=cloudfront.SecurityPolicyProtocol.SSL_V3,  # default
        ssl_method=cloudfront.SSLMethod.SNI
    )
)
```

### Trusted Key Groups

CloudFront Web Distributions supports validating signed URLs or signed cookies using key groups.
When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior.

Example:

```python
# Using trusted key groups for Cloudfront Web Distributions.
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket
# public_key: str

pub_key = cloudfront.PublicKey(self, "MyPubKey",
    encoded_key=public_key
)

key_group = cloudfront.KeyGroup(self, "MyKeyGroup",
    items=[pub_key
    ]
)

cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "AnAmazingWebsiteProbably",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=source_bucket
        ),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(
            is_default_behavior=True,
            trusted_key_groups=[key_group
            ]
        )
        ]
    )
    ]
)
```

### Restrictions

CloudFront supports adding restrictions to your distribution.

See [Restricting the Geographic Distribution of Your Content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/georestrictions.html) in the CloudFront User Guide.

Example:

```python
# Adding restrictions to a Cloudfront Web Distribution.
# source_bucket: s3.Bucket

cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "MyDistribution",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=source_bucket
        ),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(is_default_behavior=True)]
    )
    ],
    geo_restriction=cloudfront.GeoRestriction.allowlist("US", "GB")
)
```

### Connection behaviors between CloudFront and your origin

CloudFront provides you even more control over the connection behaviors between CloudFront and your origin.
You can now configure the number of connection attempts CloudFront will make to your origin and the origin connection timeout for each attempt.

See [Origin Connection Attempts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#origin-connection-attempts)

See [Origin Connection Timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#origin-connection-timeout)

Example usage:

```python
# Configuring connection behaviors between Cloudfront and your origin
distribution = cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "MyDistribution",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        connection_attempts=3,
        connection_timeout=Duration.seconds(10),
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(
            is_default_behavior=True
        )
        ]
    )
    ]
)
```

#### Origin Fallback

In case the origin source is not available and answers with one of the
specified status codes the failover origin source will be used.

```python
# Configuring origin fallback options for the CloudFrontWebDistribution
cloudfront.CloudFrontWebDistribution(self, "ADistribution",
    origin_configs=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.SourceConfiguration(
        s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(self, "aBucket", "myoriginbucket"),
            origin_path="/",
            origin_headers={
                "myHeader": "42"
            },
            origin_shield_region="us-west-2"
        ),
        failover_s3_origin_source=cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.S3OriginConfig(
            s3_bucket_source=s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(self, "aBucketFallback", "myoriginbucketfallback"),
            origin_path="/somewhere",
            origin_headers={
                "myHeader2": "21"
            },
            origin_shield_region="us-east-1"
        ),
        failover_criteria_status_codes=[cloudfront.FailoverStatusCode.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR],
        behaviors=[cloudfront.aws_cloudfront.Behavior(
            is_default_behavior=True
        )
        ]
    )
    ]
)
```

## KeyGroup & PublicKey API

You can create a key group to use with CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies
You can add public keys to use with CloudFront features such as signed URLs, signed cookies, and field-level encryption.

The following example command uses OpenSSL to generate an RSA key pair with a length of 2048 bits and save to the file named `private_key.pem`.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
```

The resulting file contains both the public and the private key. The following example command extracts the public key from the file named `private_key.pem` and stores it in `public_key.pem`.

```bash
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

Note: Don't forget to copy/paste the contents of `public_key.pem` file including `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----` lines into `encodedKey` parameter when creating a `PublicKey`.

Example:

```python
# Create a key group to use with CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies.
cloudfront.KeyGroup(self, "MyKeyGroup",
    items=[
        cloudfront.PublicKey(self, "MyPublicKey",
            encoded_key="..."
        )
    ]
)
```

    - The values that CloudFront includes in the cache key. These values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer.

CloudFront sends a request when it can't find a valid object in its cache that matches the request's cache key. If you want to send values to the origin but *not* include them in the cache key, use ``OriginRequestPolicy`` .

For more information, see `Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            '''A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.

            You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

            For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see `Quotas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            If you don't want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don't include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.

            To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.

            To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

            For more information about cache behaviors, see `Cache Behavior Settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            :param path_pattern: The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg`` ) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution. .. epigraph:: You can optionally include a slash ( ``/`` ) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg`` . CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/`` . The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior. For more information, see `Path Pattern <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param target_origin_id: The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they match this cache behavior.
            :param viewer_protocol_policy: The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options: - ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. - ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. - ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . .. epigraph:: The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param allowed_methods: A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices: - CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. - CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. - CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.
            :param cached_methods: A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices: - CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. - CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.
            :param cache_policy_id: The unique identifier of the cache policy that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .
            :param compress: Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false. For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param default_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param field_level_encryption_id: The value of ``ID`` for the field-level encryption configuration that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting specific fields of data for this cache behavior.
            :param forwarded_values: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`_ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` . A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.
            :param function_associations: A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.
            :param lambda_function_associations: A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.
            :param max_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param min_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).
            :param origin_request_policy_id: The unique identifier of the origin request policy that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`_ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param realtime_log_config_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see `Real-time logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param response_headers_policy_id: The identifier for a response headers policy.
            :param smooth_streaming: Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` .
            :param trusted_key_groups: A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies. When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param trusted_signers: .. epigraph:: We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` . A list of AWS account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies. When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in the trusted signer's AWS account . The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

               The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.

There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example: - Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200`` , the response typically won't be intercepted. - If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors. - You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down. If you specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` .
            :param response_page_path: The path to the custom error page that you want CloudFront to return to a viewer when your origin returns the HTTP status code specified by ``ErrorCode`` , for example, ``/4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html`` . If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:. - The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors`` . Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*`` . - The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages. If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath`` , you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode`` . We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

            '''A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if request URLs don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements.

            You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

            :param target_origin_id: The value of ``ID`` for the origin that you want CloudFront to route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.
            :param viewer_protocol_policy: The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern`` . You can specify the following options: - ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS. - ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL. - ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden). For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . .. epigraph:: The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see `Managing Cache Expiration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param allowed_methods: A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices: - CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. - CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. - CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST`` , and ``DELETE`` requests. If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.
            :param cached_methods: A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices: - CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests. - CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` , ``HEAD`` , and ``OPTIONS`` requests. If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.
            :param cache_policy_id: The unique identifier of the cache policy that is attached to the default cache behavior. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` .
            :param compress: Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . For more information, see `Serving Compressed Files <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/ServingCompressedFiles.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param default_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``DefaultTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param field_level_encryption_id: The value of ``ID`` for the field-level encryption configuration that you want CloudFront to use for encrypting specific fields of data for the default cache behavior.
            :param forwarded_values: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Working with policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`_ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . A ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues`` . We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId`` . A complex type that specifies how CloudFront handles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.
            :param function_associations: A list of CloudFront functions that are associated with this cache behavior. CloudFront functions must be published to the ``LIVE`` stage to associate them with a cache behavior.
            :param lambda_function_associations: A complex type that contains zero or more Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache behavior.
            :param max_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age`` , ``Cache-Control s-maxage`` , and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param min_ttl: This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MinTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see `Creating cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy>`_ or `Using the managed cache policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . The minimum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. For more information, see `Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers`` , if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name`` ).
            :param origin_request_policy_id: The unique identifier of the origin request policy that is attached to the default cache behavior. For more information, see `Creating origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy>`_ or `Using the managed origin request policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param realtime_log_config_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration that is attached to this cache behavior. For more information, see `Real-time logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param response_headers_policy_id: The identifier for a response headers policy.
            :param smooth_streaming: Indicates whether you want to distribute media files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format using the origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify ``true`` ; if not, specify ``false`` . If you specify ``true`` for ``SmoothStreaming`` , you can still distribute other content using this cache behavior if the content matches the value of ``PathPattern`` .
            :param trusted_key_groups: A list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies. When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with a private key whose corresponding public key is in the key group. The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param trusted_signers: .. epigraph:: We recommend using ``TrustedKeyGroups`` instead of ``TrustedSigners`` . A list of AWS account IDs whose public keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies. When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed with the private key of a CloudFront key pair in a trusted signer's AWS account . The signed URL or cookie contains information about which public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature. For more information, see `Serving private content <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            - ``allow-all`` : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.
            - ``redirect-to-https`` : If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.
            - ``https-only`` : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).

            For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see `Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            .. epigraph::

               The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.

            '''A distribution configuration.

            :param default_cache_behavior: A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't specify a ``CacheBehavior`` element or if files don't match any of the values of ``PathPattern`` in ``CacheBehavior`` elements. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.
            :param enabled: From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.
            :param aliases: A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain names), if any, for this distribution.
            :param cache_behaviors: A complex type that contains zero or more ``CacheBehavior`` elements.
            :param cnam_es: ``CfnDistribution.DistributionConfigProperty.CNAMEs``.
            :param comment: A comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.
            :param continuous_deployment_policy_id: The identifier of a continuous deployment policy. For more information, see ``CreateContinuousDeploymentPolicy`` .
            :param custom_error_responses: A complex type that controls the following:. - Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer. - How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range. For more information about custom error pages, see `Customizing Error Responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param custom_origin: ``CfnDistribution.DistributionConfigProperty.CustomOrigin``.
            :param default_root_object: The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, ``index.html`` ) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution ( ``https://www.example.com`` ) instead of an object in your distribution ( ``https://www.example.com/product-description.html`` ). Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution. Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html`` . Don't add a ``/`` before the object name. If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a distribution, include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element. To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include an empty ``DefaultRootObject`` element. To replace the default root object, update the distribution configuration and specify the new object. For more information about the default root object, see `Creating a Default Root Object <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param http_version: (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version(s) that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront . The default value for new distributions is ``http1.1`` . For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLSv1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Indication (SNI). For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/3, viewers must support TLSv1.3 and Server Name Indication (SNI). CloudFront supports HTTP/3 connection migration to allow the viewer to switch networks without losing connection. For more information about connection migration, see `Connection Migration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-connection-migration>`_ at RFC 9000. For more information about supported TLSv1.3 ciphers, see `Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html>`_ .
            :param ipv6_enabled: If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true`` . If you specify ``false`` , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see `Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . If you're using an Amazon Route 53 AWS Integration alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true: - You enable IPv6 for the distribution - You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects For more information, see `Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html>`_ in the *Amazon Route 53 AWS Integration Developer Guide* . If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Amazon Route 53 AWS Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.
            :param logging: A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the distribution. For more information about logging, see `Access Logs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param origin_groups: A complex type that contains information about origin groups for this distribution.
            :param origins: A complex type that contains information about origins for this distribution.
            :param price_class: The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations. If you specify a price class other than ``PriceClass_All`` , CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower performance. For more information about price classes, see `Choosing the Price Class for a CloudFront Distribution <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . For information about CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class 100) map to CloudFront regions, see `Amazon CloudFront Pricing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/>`_ .
            :param restrictions: A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict distribution of your content.
            :param s3_origin: ``CfnDistribution.DistributionConfigProperty.S3Origin``.
            :param staging: A Boolean that indicates whether this is a staging distribution. When this value is ``true`` , this is a staging distribution. When this value is ``false`` , this is not a staging distribution.
            :param viewer_certificate: A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.
            :param web_acl_id: A unique identifier that specifies the AWS WAF web ACL, if any, to associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of AWS WAF , use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . To specify a web ACL created using AWS WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a`` . AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about AWS WAF , see the `AWS WAF Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html>`_ .

However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions.

            Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , if any:

            If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

            If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys`` , CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

            If you specify false for ``QueryString`` , CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

            An origin is the location where content is stored, and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. To specify an origin:

            - Use ``S3OriginConfig`` to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting.
            - Use ``CustomOriginConfig`` to specify all other kinds of origins, including:
            - An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting
            - An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer
            - An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint
            - An AWS Elemental MediaStore container
            - Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon EC2 instance or any other kind of host

            For the current maximum number of origins that you can specify per distribution, see `General Quotas on Web Distributions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* (quotas were formerly referred to as limits).

            :param domain_name: The domain name for the origin. For more information, see `Origin Domain Name <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param id: A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution. Use this value to specify the ``TargetOriginId`` in a ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` .
            :param connection_attempts: The number of times that CloudFront attempts to connect to the origin. The minimum number is 1, the maximum is 3, and the default (if you don't specify otherwise) is 3. For a custom origin (including an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured with static website hosting), this value also specifies the number of times that CloudFront attempts to get a response from the origin, in the case of an `Origin Response Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginResponseTimeout>`_ . For more information, see `Origin Connection Attempts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#origin-connection-attempts>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param connection_timeout: The number of seconds that CloudFront waits when trying to establish a connection to the origin. The minimum timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 10 seconds, and the default (if you don't specify otherwise) is 10 seconds. For more information, see `Origin Connection Timeout <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#origin-connection-timeout>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param custom_origin_config: Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the Amazon S3 bucket is configured with static website hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured with static website hosting, use the ``S3OriginConfig`` type instead.
            :param origin_access_control_id: The unique identifier of an origin access control for this origin. For more information, see `Restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param origin_custom_headers: A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront adds to the requests that it sends to the origin. For more information, see `Adding Custom Headers to Origin Requests <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/add-origin-custom-headers.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param origin_path: An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin domain name when CloudFront requests content from the origin. For more information, see `Origin Path <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param origin_shield: CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help reduce the load on your origin. For more information, see `Using Origin Shield <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            :param s3_origin_config: Use this type to specify an origin that is an Amazon S3 bucket that is not configured with static website hosting. To specify any other type of origin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static website hosting, use the ``CustomOriginConfig`` type instead.

            '''A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.

            If the distribution doesn't use ``Aliases`` (also known as alternate domain names or CNAMEs)—that is, if the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` —set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` and leave all other fields empty.

            If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), use the fields in this type to specify the following settings:

            - Which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from: only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`_ (recommended), or all viewers including those that don't support SNI.
            - To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers that support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod`` . Note the different capitalization.)
            - To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that don't support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``vip`` . This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod`` . Note the different capitalization.)
            - The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that the distribution can use to communicate with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a value for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` . For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .
            - The location of the SSL/TLS certificate, `AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`_ (recommended) or `AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`_ . You specify the location by setting a value in one of the following fields (not both):
            - ``ACMCertificateArn`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``AcmCertificateArn`` . Note the different capitalization.)
            - ``IAMCertificateId`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``IamCertificateId`` . Note the different capitalization.)

            All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers. To require viewers to use HTTPS only, or to redirect them from HTTP to HTTPS, use ``ViewerProtocolPolicy`` in the ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior`` . To specify how CloudFront should use SSL/TLS to communicate with your custom origin, use ``CustomOriginConfig`` .

            For more information, see `Using HTTPS with CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https.html>`_ and `Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-alternate-domain-names.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

            :param acm_certificate_arn: .. epigraph:: In CloudFormation, this field name is ``AcmCertificateArn`` . Note the different capitalization. If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html>`_ , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Region ( ``us-east-1`` ). If you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod`` . Note the different capitalization.)
            :param cloud_front_default_certificate: If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , set this field to ``true`` . If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), set this field to ``false`` and specify values for the following fields: - ``ACMCertificateArn`` or ``IAMCertificateId`` (specify a value for one, not both) In CloudFormation, these field names are ``AcmCertificateArn`` and ``IamCertificateId`` . Note the different capitalization. - ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` - ``SSLSupportMethod`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``SslSupportMethod`` . Note the different capitalization.)
            :param iam_certificate_id: .. epigraph:: In CloudFormation, this field name is ``IamCertificateId`` . Note the different capitalization. If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in `AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html>`_ , provide the ID of the IAM certificate. If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also specify values for ``MinimumProtocolVersion`` and ``SSLSupportMethod`` . (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod`` . Note the different capitalization.)
            :param minimum_protocol_version: If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security policy determines two settings: - The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to communicate with viewers. - The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. For more information, see `Security Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy>`_ and `Supported Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* . .. epigraph:: On the CloudFront console, this setting is called *Security Policy* . When you're using SNI only (you set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only`` ), you must specify ``TLSv1`` or higher. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod`` . Note the different capitalization.) If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` (you set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` ), CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to ``TLSv1`` regardless of the value that you set here.
            :param ssl_support_method: .. epigraph:: In CloudFormation, this field name is ``SslSupportMethod`` . Note the different capitalization. If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from. - ``sni-only`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from only viewers that support `server name indication (SNI) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`_ . This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. - ``vip`` – The distribution accepts HTTPS connections from all viewers including those that don't support SNI. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. - ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the `AWS Support Center <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home>`_ . If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`` , don't set a value for this field.

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::CloudFront::Function``.

    Creates a CloudFront function.

    To create a function, you provide the function code and some configuration information about the function. The response contains an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the function, and the function’s stage.

    By default, when you create a function, it’s in the ``DEVELOPMENT`` stage. In this stage, you can `test the function <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/test-function.html>`_ in the CloudFront console (or with ``TestFunction`` in the CloudFront API).

    When you’re ready to use your function with a CloudFront distribution, publish the function to the ``LIVE`` stage. You can do this in the CloudFront console, with ``PublishFunction`` in the CloudFront API, or by updating the ``AWS::CloudFront::Function`` resource with the ``AutoPublish`` property set to ``true`` . When the function is published to the ``LIVE`` stage, you can attach it to a distribution’s cache behavior, using the function’s ARN.

    To automatically publish the function to the ``LIVE`` stage when it’s created, set the ``AutoPublish`` property to ``true`` .

            This makes it possible to block public access to the origin, allowing viewers (users) to access the origin's content only through CloudFront.

            For more information about using a CloudFront origin access control, see `Restricting access to an AWS origin <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-origin.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

If the viewer request contains the ``Authorization`` header, then CloudFront doesn't sign the origin request and instead passes along the ``Authorization`` header from the viewer request. *WARNING: To pass along the ``Authorization`` header from the viewer request, you *must* add the ``Authorization`` header to a `cache policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html>`_ for all cache behaviors that use origins associated with this origin access control.*

    When it's attached to a cache behavior, the origin request policy determines the values that CloudFront includes in requests that it sends to the origin. Each request that CloudFront sends to the origin includes the following:

    - The request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the viewer request.
    - The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin request, including ``Host`` , ``User-Agent`` , and ``X-Amz-Cf-Id`` .
    - All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified in the cache policy or the origin request policy. These can include items from the viewer request and, in the case of headers, additional ones that are added by CloudFront.

    CloudFront sends a request when it can't find an object in its cache that matches the request. If you want to send values to the origin and also include them in the cache key, use ``CachePolicy`` .

    A response headers policy.

    A response headers policy contains information about a set of HTTP response headers.

    After you create a response headers policy, you can use its ID to attach it to one or more cache behaviors in a CloudFront distribution. When it's attached to a cache behavior, the response headers policy affects the HTTP headers that CloudFront includes in HTTP responses to requests that match the cache behavior. CloudFront adds or removes response headers according to the configuration of the response headers policy.

    For more information, see `Adding or removing HTTP headers in CloudFront responses <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/modifying-response-headers.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide* .

        :param certificate: (experimental) A certificate to associate with the distribution. The certificate must be located in N. Virginia (us-east-1). Default: - the CloudFront wildcard certificate (*.cloudfront.net) will be used.
        :param comment: (experimental) Any comments you want to include about the distribution. Default: - no comment
        :param default_root_object: (experimental) The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, index.html) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution. If no default object is set, the request goes to the origin's root (e.g., example.com/). Default: - no default root object
        :param domain_names: (experimental) Alternative domain names for this distribution. If you want to use your own domain name, such as www.example.com, instead of the cloudfront.net domain name, you can add an alternate domain name to your distribution. If you attach a certificate to the distribution, you must add (at least one of) the domain names of the certificate to this list. Default: - The distribution will only support the default generated name (e.g., d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net)
        :param enabled: (experimental) Enable or disable the distribution. Default: true
        :param enable_ipv6: (experimental) Whether CloudFront will respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address. If you specify false, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code NOERROR and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. Default: true
        :param enable_logging: (experimental) Enable access logging for the distribution. Default: - false, unless ``logBucket`` is specified.
        :param error_responses: (experimental) How CloudFront should handle requests that are not successful (e.g., PageNotFound). Default: - No custom error responses.
        :param geo_restriction: (experimental) Controls the countries in which your content is distributed. Default: - No geographic restrictions
        :param http_version: (experimental) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support server name identification (SNI). Default: HttpVersion.HTTP2
        :param log_bucket: (experimental) The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in. Default: - A bucket is created if ``enableLogging`` is true
        :param log_file_prefix: (experimental) An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log filenames for this distribution. Default: - no prefix
        :param log_includes_cookies: (experimental) Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs. Default: false
        :param minimum_protocol_version: (experimental) The minimum version of the SSL protocol that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections. CloudFront serves your objects only to browsers or devices that support at least the SSL version that you specify. Default: - SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_2_2021 if the '
        :param price_class: (experimental) The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify PriceClass_All, CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations. If you specify a price class other than PriceClass_All, CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Default: PriceClass.PRICE_CLASS_ALL
        :param ssl_support_method: (experimental) The SSL method CloudFront will use for your distribution. Server Name Indication (SNI) - is an extension to the TLS computer networking protocol by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows a server to present multiple certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate. CloudFront can use SNI to host multiple distributions on the same IP - which a large majority of clients will support. If your clients cannot support SNI however - CloudFront can use dedicated IPs for your distribution - but there is a prorated monthly charge for using this feature. By default, we use SNI - but you can optionally enable dedicated IPs (VIP). See the CloudFront SSL for more details about pricing : https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/custom-ssl-domains/ Default: SSLMethod.SNI
        :param web_acl_id: (experimental) Unique identifier that specifies the AWS WAF web ACL to associate with this CloudFront distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of AWS WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a``. To specify a web ACL created using AWS WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a``. Default: - No AWS Web Application Firewall web access control list (web ACL).

        using this feature. By default, we use SNI - but you can optionally enable dedicated IPs (VIP).

    Server Name Indication (SNI) - is an extension to the TLS computer networking protocol by which a client indicates
    which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows a server to present
    multiple certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites
    (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate.

    CloudFront can use SNI to host multiple distributions on the same IP - which a large majority of clients will support.

    If your clients cannot support SNI however - CloudFront can use dedicated IPs for your distribution - but there is a prorated monthly charge for
    using this feature. By default, we use SNI - but you can optionally enable dedicated IPs (VIP).

        :param default_behavior: (experimental) The default behavior for the distribution.
        :param additional_behaviors: (experimental) Additional behaviors for the distribution, mapped by the pathPattern that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. Default: - no additional behaviors are added.
        :param certificate: (experimental) A certificate to associate with the distribution. The certificate must be located in N. Virginia (us-east-1). Default: - the CloudFront wildcard certificate (*.cloudfront.net) will be used.
        :param comment: (experimental) Any comments you want to include about the distribution. Default: - no comment
        :param default_root_object: (experimental) The object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin (for example, index.html) when a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution. If no default object is set, the request goes to the origin's root (e.g., example.com/). Default: - no default root object
        :param domain_names: (experimental) Alternative domain names for this distribution. If you want to use your own domain name, such as www.example.com, instead of the cloudfront.net domain name, you can add an alternate domain name to your distribution. If you attach a certificate to the distribution, you must add (at least one of) the domain names of the certificate to this list. Default: - The distribution will only support the default generated name (e.g., d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net)
        :param enabled: (experimental) Enable or disable the distribution. Default: true
        :param enable_ipv6: (experimental) Whether CloudFront will respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address. If you specify false, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code NOERROR and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution. Default: true
        :param enable_logging: (experimental) Enable access logging for the distribution. Default: - false, unless ``logBucket`` is specified.
        :param error_responses: (experimental) How CloudFront should handle requests that are not successful (e.g., PageNotFound). Default: - No custom error responses.
        :param geo_restriction: (experimental) Controls the countries in which your content is distributed. Default: - No geographic restrictions
        :param http_version: (experimental) Specify the maximum HTTP version that you want viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLS 1.2 or later, and must support server name identification (SNI). Default: HttpVersion.HTTP2
        :param log_bucket: (experimental) The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in. Default: - A bucket is created if ``enableLogging`` is true
        :param log_file_prefix: (experimental) An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the access log filenames for this distribution. Default: - no prefix
        :param log_includes_cookies: (experimental) Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include cookies in access logs. Default: false
        :param minimum_protocol_version: (experimental) The minimum version of the SSL protocol that you want CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections. CloudFront serves your objects only to browsers or devices that support at least the SSL version that you specify. Default: - SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_2_2021 if the '
        :param price_class: (experimental) The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify PriceClass_All, CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront edge locations. If you specify a price class other than PriceClass_All, CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Default: PriceClass.PRICE_CLASS_ALL
        :param ssl_support_method: (experimental) The SSL method CloudFront will use for your distribution. Server Name Indication (SNI) - is an extension to the TLS computer networking protocol by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows a server to present multiple certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence allows multiple secure (HTTPS) websites (or any other service over TLS) to be served by the same IP address without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate. CloudFront can use SNI to host multiple distributions on the same IP - which a large majority of clients will support. If your clients cannot support SNI however - CloudFront can use dedicated IPs for your distribution - but there is a prorated monthly charge for using this feature. By default, we use SNI - but you can optionally enable dedicated IPs (VIP). See the CloudFront SSL for more details about pricing : https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/custom-ssl-domains/ Default: SSLMethod.SNI
        :param web_acl_id: (experimental) Unique identifier that specifies the AWS WAF web ACL to associate with this CloudFront distribution. To specify a web ACL created using the latest version of AWS WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example ``arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a``. To specify a web ACL created using AWS WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example ``473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a``. Default: - No AWS Web Application Firewall web access control list (web ACL).

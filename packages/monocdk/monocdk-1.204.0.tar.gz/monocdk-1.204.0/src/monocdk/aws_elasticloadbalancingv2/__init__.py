# Amazon Elastic Load Balancing V2 Construct Library

The `@aws-cdk/aws-elasticloadbalancingv2` package provides constructs for
configuring application and network load balancers.

For more information, see the AWS documentation for
[Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)
and [Network Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html).

## Defining an Application Load Balancer

You define an application load balancer by creating an instance of
`ApplicationLoadBalancer`, adding a Listener to the load balancer
and adding Targets to the Listener:

```python
from monocdk.aws_autoscaling import AutoScalingGroup
# asg: AutoScalingGroup

# vpc: ec2.Vpc


# Create the load balancer in a VPC. 'internetFacing' is 'false'
# by default, which creates an internal load balancer.
lb = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(self, "LB",
    vpc=vpc,
    internet_facing=True
)

# Add a listener and open up the load balancer's security group
# to the world.
listener = lb.add_listener("Listener",
    port=80,

    # 'open: true' is the default, you can leave it out if you want. Set it
    # to 'false' and use `listener.connections` if you want to be selective
    # about who can access the load balancer.
    open=True
)

# Create an AutoScaling group and add it as a load balancing
# target to the listener.
listener.add_targets("ApplicationFleet",
    port=8080,
    targets=[asg]
)
```

The security groups of the load balancer and the target are automatically
updated to allow the network traffic.

One (or more) security groups can be associated with the load balancer;
if a security group isn't provided, one will be automatically created.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


security_group1 = ec2.SecurityGroup(self, "SecurityGroup1", vpc=vpc)
lb = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(self, "LB",
    vpc=vpc,
    internet_facing=True,
    security_group=security_group1
)

security_group2 = ec2.SecurityGroup(self, "SecurityGroup2", vpc=vpc)
lb.add_security_group(security_group2)
```

### Conditions

It's possible to route traffic to targets based on conditions in the incoming
HTTP request. For example, the following will route requests to the indicated
AutoScalingGroup only if the requested host in the request is either for
`example.com/ok` or `example.com/path`:

```python
# listener: elbv2.ApplicationListener
# asg: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


listener.add_targets("Example.Com Fleet",
    priority=10,
    conditions=[
        elbv2.ListenerCondition.host_headers(["example.com"]),
        elbv2.ListenerCondition.path_patterns(["/ok", "/path"])
    ],
    port=8080,
    targets=[asg]
)
```

A target with a condition contains either `pathPatterns` or `hostHeader`, or
both. If both are specified, both conditions must be met for the requests to
be routed to the given target. `priority` is a required field when you add
targets with conditions. The lowest number wins.

Every listener must have at least one target without conditions, which is
where all requests that didn't match any of the conditions will be sent.

### Convenience methods and more complex Actions

Routing traffic from a Load Balancer to a Target involves the following steps:

* Create a Target Group, register the Target into the Target Group
* Add an Action to the Listener which forwards traffic to the Target Group.

A new listener can be added to the Load Balancer by calling `addListener()`.
Listeners that have been added to the load balancer can be listed using the
`listeners` property.  Note that the `listeners` property will throw an Error
for imported or looked up Load Balancers.

Various methods on the `Listener` take care of this work for you to a greater
or lesser extent:

* `addTargets()` performs both steps: automatically creates a Target Group and the
  required Action.
* `addTargetGroups()` gives you more control: you create the Target Group (or
  Target Groups) yourself and the method creates Action that routes traffic to
  the Target Groups.
* `addAction()` gives you full control: you supply the Action and wire it up
  to the Target Groups yourself (or access one of the other ELB routing features).

Using `addAction()` gives you access to some of the features of an Elastic Load
Balancer that the other two convenience methods don't:

* **Routing stickiness**: use `ListenerAction.forward()` and supply a
  `stickinessDuration` to make sure requests are routed to the same target group
  for a given duration.
* **Weighted Target Groups**: use `ListenerAction.weightedForward()`
  to give different weights to different target groups.
* **Fixed Responses**: use `ListenerAction.fixedResponse()` to serve
  a static response (ALB only).
* **Redirects**: use `ListenerAction.redirect()` to serve an HTTP
  redirect response (ALB only).
* **Authentication**: use `ListenerAction.authenticateOidc()` to
  perform OpenID authentication before serving a request (see the
  `@aws-cdk/aws-elasticloadbalancingv2-actions` package for direct authentication
  integration with Cognito) (ALB only).

Here's an example of serving a fixed response at the `/ok` URL:

```python
# listener: elbv2.ApplicationListener


listener.add_action("Fixed",
    priority=10,
    conditions=[
        elbv2.ListenerCondition.path_patterns(["/ok"])
    ],
    action=elbv2.ListenerAction.fixed_response(200,
        content_type=elbv2.ContentType.TEXT_PLAIN,
        message_body="OK"
    )
)
```

Here's an example of using OIDC authentication before forwarding to a TargetGroup:

```python
# listener: elbv2.ApplicationListener
# my_target_group: elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup


listener.add_action("DefaultAction",
    action=elbv2.ListenerAction.authenticate_oidc(
        authorization_endpoint="https://example.com/openid",
        # Other OIDC properties here
        client_id="...",
        client_secret=SecretValue.secrets_manager("..."),
        issuer="...",
        token_endpoint="...",
        user_info_endpoint="...",

        # Next
        next=elbv2.ListenerAction.forward([my_target_group])
    )
)
```

If you just want to redirect all incoming traffic on one port to another port, you can use the following code:

```python
# lb: elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer


lb.add_redirect(
    source_protocol=elbv2.ApplicationProtocol.HTTPS,
    source_port=8443,
    target_protocol=elbv2.ApplicationProtocol.HTTP,
    target_port=8080
)
```

If you do not provide any options for this method, it redirects HTTP port 80 to HTTPS port 443.

By default all ingress traffic will be allowed on the source port. If you want to be more selective with your
ingress rules then set `open: false` and use the listener's `connections` object to selectively grant access to the listener.

## Defining a Network Load Balancer

Network Load Balancers are defined in a similar way to Application Load
Balancers:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# asg: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


# Create the load balancer in a VPC. 'internetFacing' is 'false'
# by default, which creates an internal load balancer.
lb = elbv2.NetworkLoadBalancer(self, "LB",
    vpc=vpc,
    internet_facing=True
)

# Add a listener on a particular port.
listener = lb.add_listener("Listener",
    port=443
)

# Add targets on a particular port.
listener.add_targets("AppFleet",
    port=443,
    targets=[asg]
)
```

One thing to keep in mind is that network load balancers do not have security
groups, and no automatic security group configuration is done for you. You will
have to configure the security groups of the target yourself to allow traffic by
clients and/or load balancer instances, depending on your target types.  See
[Target Groups for your Network Load
Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html)
and [Register targets with your Target
Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-register-targets.html)
for more information.

## Targets and Target Groups

Application and Network Load Balancers organize load balancing targets in Target
Groups. If you add your balancing targets (such as AutoScalingGroups, ECS
services or individual instances) to your listener directly, the appropriate
`TargetGroup` will be automatically created for you.

If you need more control over the Target Groups created, create an instance of
`ApplicationTargetGroup` or `NetworkTargetGroup`, add the members you desire,
and add it to the listener by calling `addTargetGroups` instead of `addTargets`.

`addTargets()` will always return the Target Group it just created for you:

```python
# listener: elbv2.NetworkListener
# asg1: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup
# asg2: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


group = listener.add_targets("AppFleet",
    port=443,
    targets=[asg1]
)

group.add_target(asg2)
```

### Sticky sessions for your Application Load Balancer

By default, an Application Load Balancer routes each request independently to a registered target based on the chosen load-balancing algorithm. However, you can use the sticky session feature (also known as session affinity) to enable the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific target. This ensures that all requests from the user during the session are sent to the same target. This feature is useful for servers that maintain state information in order to provide a continuous experience to clients. To use sticky sessions, the client must support cookies.

Application Load Balancers support both duration-based cookies (`lb_cookie`) and application-based cookies (`app_cookie`). The key to managing sticky sessions is determining how long your load balancer should consistently route the user's request to the same target. Sticky sessions are enabled at the target group level. You can use a combination of duration-based stickiness, application-based stickiness, and no stickiness across all of your target groups.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


# Target group with duration-based stickiness with load-balancer generated cookie
tg1 = elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup(self, "TG1",
    target_type=elbv2.TargetType.INSTANCE,
    port=80,
    stickiness_cookie_duration=Duration.minutes(5),
    vpc=vpc
)

# Target group with application-based stickiness
tg2 = elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup(self, "TG2",
    target_type=elbv2.TargetType.INSTANCE,
    port=80,
    stickiness_cookie_duration=Duration.minutes(5),
    stickiness_cookie_name="MyDeliciousCookie",
    vpc=vpc
)
```

For more information see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/sticky-sessions.html#application-based-stickiness

### Setting the target group protocol version

By default, Application Load Balancers send requests to targets using HTTP/1.1. You can use the [protocol version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html#target-group-protocol-version) to send requests to targets using HTTP/2 or gRPC.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


tg = elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup(self, "TG",
    target_type=elbv2.TargetType.IP,
    port=50051,
    protocol=elbv2.ApplicationProtocol.HTTP,
    protocol_version=elbv2.ApplicationProtocolVersion.GRPC,
    health_check=elbv2.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2.HealthCheck(
        enabled=True,
        healthy_grpc_codes="0-99"
    ),
    vpc=vpc
)
```

## Using Lambda Targets

To use a Lambda Function as a target, use the integration class in the
`@aws-cdk/aws-elasticloadbalancingv2-targets` package:

```python
import monocdk as lambda_
import monocdk as targets

# lambda_function: lambda.Function
# lb: elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer


listener = lb.add_listener("Listener", port=80)
listener.add_targets("Targets",
    targets=[targets.LambdaTarget(lambda_function)],

    # For Lambda Targets, you need to explicitly enable health checks if you
    # want them.
    health_check=lambda.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2.HealthCheck(
        enabled=True
    )
)
```

Only a single Lambda function can be added to a single listener rule.

## Using Application Load Balancer Targets

To use a single application load balancer as a target for the network load balancer, use the integration class in the
`@aws-cdk/aws-elasticloadbalancingv2-targets` package:

```python
import monocdk as targets
import monocdk as ecs
import monocdk as patterns

# vpc: ec2.Vpc


task = ecs.FargateTaskDefinition(self, "Task", cpu=256, memory_limit_mi_b=512)
task.add_container("nginx",
    image=ecs.ContainerImage.from_registry("public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx:latest"),
    port_mappings=[targets.aws_ecs.PortMapping(container_port=80)]
)

svc = patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService(self, "Service",
    vpc=vpc,
    task_definition=task,
    public_load_balancer=False
)

nlb = elbv2.NetworkLoadBalancer(self, "Nlb",
    vpc=vpc,
    cross_zone_enabled=True,
    internet_facing=True
)

listener = nlb.add_listener("listener", port=80)

listener.add_targets("Targets",
    targets=[targets.AlbTarget(svc.load_balancer, 80)],
    port=80
)

CfnOutput(self, "NlbEndpoint", value=f"http://{nlb.loadBalancerDnsName}")
```

Only the network load balancer is allowed to add the application load balancer as the target.

## Configuring Health Checks

Health checks are configured upon creation of a target group:

```python
# listener: elbv2.ApplicationListener
# asg: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


listener.add_targets("AppFleet",
    port=8080,
    targets=[asg],
    health_check=elbv2.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2.HealthCheck(
        path="/ping",
        interval=Duration.minutes(1)
    )
)
```

The health check can also be configured after creation by calling
`configureHealthCheck()` on the created object.

No attempts are made to configure security groups for the port you're
configuring a health check for, but if the health check is on the same port
you're routing traffic to, the security group already allows the traffic.
If not, you will have to configure the security groups appropriately:

```python
# lb: elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer
# listener: elbv2.ApplicationListener
# asg: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


listener.add_targets("AppFleet",
    port=8080,
    targets=[asg],
    health_check=elbv2.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2.HealthCheck(
        port="8088"
    )
)

asg.connections.allow_from(lb, ec2.Port.tcp(8088))
```

## Using a Load Balancer from a different Stack

If you want to put your Load Balancer and the Targets it is load balancing to in
different stacks, you may not be able to use the convenience methods
`loadBalancer.addListener()` and `listener.addTargets()`.

The reason is that these methods will create resources in the same Stack as the
object they're called on, which may lead to cyclic references between stacks.
Instead, you will have to create an `ApplicationListener` in the target stack,
or an empty `TargetGroup` in the load balancer stack that you attach your
service to.

For an example of the alternatives while load balancing to an ECS service, see the
[ecs/cross-stack-load-balancer
example](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/typescript/ecs/cross-stack-load-balancer/).

## Protocol for Load Balancer Targets

Constructs that want to be a load balancer target should implement
`IApplicationLoadBalancerTarget` and/or `INetworkLoadBalancerTarget`, and
provide an implementation for the function `attachToXxxTargetGroup()`, which can
call functions on the load balancer and should return metadata about the
load balancing target:

```python
class MyTarget(elbv2.IApplicationLoadBalancerTarget):
    def attach_to_application_target_group(self, target_group):
        # If we need to add security group rules
        # targetGroup.registerConnectable(...);
        return elbv2.aws_elasticloadbalancingv2.LoadBalancerTargetProps(
            target_type=elbv2.TargetType.IP,
            target_json={"id": "1.2.3.4", "port": 8080}
        )
```

`targetType` should be one of `Instance` or `Ip`. If the target can be
directly added to the target group, `targetJson` should contain the `id` of
the target (either instance ID or IP address depending on the type) and
optionally a `port` or `availabilityZone` override.

Application load balancer targets can call `registerConnectable()` on the
target group to register themselves for addition to the load balancer's security
group rules.

If your load balancer target requires that the TargetGroup has been
associated with a LoadBalancer before registration can happen (such as is the
case for ECS Services for example), take a resource dependency on
`targetGroup.loadBalancerAttached` as follows:

```python
# resource: Resource
# target_group: elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup


# Make sure that the listener has been created, and so the TargetGroup
# has been associated with the LoadBalancer, before 'resource' is created.

Node.of(resource).add_dependency(target_group.load_balancer_attached)
```

## Looking up Load Balancers and Listeners

You may look up load balancers and load balancer listeners by using one of the
following lookup methods:

* `ApplicationLoadBalancer.fromlookup(options)` - Look up an application load
  balancer.
* `ApplicationListener.fromLookup(options)` - Look up an application load
  balancer listener.
* `NetworkLoadBalancer.fromLookup(options)` - Look up a network load balancer.
* `NetworkListener.fromLookup(options)` - Look up a network load balancer
  listener.

### Load Balancer lookup options

You may look up a load balancer by ARN or by associated tags. When you look a
load balancer up by ARN, that load balancer will be returned unless CDK detects
that the load balancer is of the wrong type. When you look up a load balancer by
tags, CDK will return the load balancer matching all specified tags. If more
than one load balancer matches, CDK will throw an error requesting that you
provide more specific criteria.

**Look up a Application Load Balancer by ARN**

```python
load_balancer = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer.from_lookup(self, "ALB",
    load_balancer_arn="arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/1234567890123456"
)
```

**Look up an Application Load Balancer by tags**

```python
load_balancer = elbv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer.from_lookup(self, "ALB",
    load_balancer_tags={
        # Finds a load balancer matching all tags.
        "some": "tag",
        "someother": "tag"
    }
)
```

## Load Balancer Listener lookup options

You may look up a load balancer listener by the following criteria:

* Associated load balancer ARN
* Associated load balancer tags
* Listener ARN
* Listener port
* Listener protocol

The lookup method will return the matching listener. If more than one listener
matches, CDK will throw an error requesting that you specify additional
criteria.

**Look up a Listener by associated Load Balancer, Port, and Protocol**

```python
listener = elbv2.ApplicationListener.from_lookup(self, "ALBListener",
    load_balancer_arn="arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/1234567890123456",
    listener_protocol=elbv2.ApplicationProtocol.HTTPS,
    listener_port=443
)
```

**Look up a Listener by associated Load Balancer Tag, Port, and Protocol**

```python
listener = elbv2.ApplicationListener.from_lookup(self, "ALBListener",
    load_balancer_tags={
        "Cluster": "MyClusterName"
    },
    listener_protocol=elbv2.ApplicationProtocol.HTTPS,
    listener_port=443
)
```

**Look up a Network Listener by associated Load Balancer Tag, Port, and Protocol**

```python
listener = elbv2.NetworkListener.from_lookup(self, "ALBListener",
    load_balancer_tags={
        "Cluster": "MyClusterName"
    },
    listener_protocol=elbv2.Protocol.TCP,
    listener_port=12345
)
```

If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID for the load balancer. If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource, but you can perform other updates. To replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param scheme: The nodes of an Internet-facing load balancer have public IP addresses. The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the internet. The nodes of an internal load balancer have only private IP addresses. The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the private IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can route requests only from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer. The default is an Internet-facing load balancer. You cannot specify a scheme for a Gateway Load Balancer.
        :param security_groups: [Application Load Balancers] The IDs of the security groups for the load balancer.
        :param subnet_mappings: The IDs of the public subnets. You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone. You must specify either subnets or subnet mappings, but not both. [Application Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at least two Availability Zones. You cannot specify Elastic IP addresses for your subnets. [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] You must specify one Outpost subnet. [Application Load Balancers on Local Zones] You can specify subnets from one or more Local Zones. [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones. You can specify one Elastic IP address per subnet if you need static IP addresses for your internet-facing load balancer. For internal load balancers, you can specify one private IP address per subnet from the IPv4 range of the subnet. For internet-facing load balancer, you can specify one IPv6 address per subnet. [Gateway Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones. You cannot specify Elastic IP addresses for your subnets.
        :param subnets: The IDs of the public subnets. You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone. You must specify either subnets or subnet mappings, but not both. To specify an Elastic IP address, specify subnet mappings instead of subnets. [Application Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at least two Availability Zones. [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] You must specify one Outpost subnet. [Application Load Balancers on Local Zones] You can specify subnets from one or more Local Zones. [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones. [Gateway Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones.
        :param tags: The tags to assign to the load balancer.
        :param type: The type of load balancer. The default is ``application`` .

The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . - ``access_logs.s3.bucket`` - The name of the S3 bucket for the access logs. This attribute is required if access logs are enabled. The bucket must exist in the same region as the load balancer and have a bucket policy that grants Elastic Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket. - ``access_logs.s3.prefix`` - The prefix for the location in the S3 bucket for the access logs. - ``ipv6.deny_all_igw_traffic`` - Blocks internet gateway (IGW) access to the load balancer. It is set to ``false`` for internet-facing load balancers and ``true`` for internal load balancers, preventing unintended access to your internal load balancer through an internet gateway. The following attributes are supported by only Application Load Balancers: - ``idle_timeout.timeout_seconds`` - The idle timeout value, in seconds. The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default is 60 seconds. - ``routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode`` - Determines how the load balancer handles requests that might pose a security risk to your application. The possible values are ``monitor`` , ``defensive`` , and ``strictest`` . The default is ``defensive`` . - ``routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled`` - Indicates whether HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed by the load balancer ( ``true`` ) or routed to targets ( ``false`` ). The default is ``false`` . - ``routing.http.preserve_host_header.enabled`` - Indicates whether the Application Load Balancer should preserve the ``Host`` header in the HTTP request and send it to the target without any change. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . - ``routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled`` - Indicates whether the two headers ( ``x-amzn-tls-version`` and ``x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite`` ), which contain information about the negotiated TLS version and cipher suite, are added to the client request before sending it to the target. The ``x-amzn-tls-version`` header has information about the TLS protocol version negotiated with the client, and the ``x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite`` header has information about the cipher suite negotiated with the client. Both headers are in OpenSSL format. The possible values for the attribute are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . - ``routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled`` - Indicates whether the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header should preserve the source port that the client used to connect to the load balancer. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false`` .

            The following attributes are supported by all load balancers:

            - ``deletion_protection.enabled`` - Indicates whether deletion protection is enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .
            - ``load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled`` - Indicates whether cross-zone load balancing is enabled. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default for Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers is ``false`` . The default for Application Load Balancers is ``true`` , and cannot be changed.

            The following attributes are supported by both Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

            - ``access_logs.s3.enabled`` - Indicates whether access logs are enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .
            - ``access_logs.s3.bucket`` - The name of the S3 bucket for the access logs. This attribute is required if access logs are enabled. The bucket must exist in the same region as the load balancer and have a bucket policy that grants Elastic Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket.
            - ``access_logs.s3.prefix`` - The prefix for the location in the S3 bucket for the access logs.
            - ``ipv6.deny_all_igw_traffic`` - Blocks internet gateway (IGW) access to the load balancer. It is set to ``false`` for internet-facing load balancers and ``true`` for internal load balancers, preventing unintended access to your internal load balancer through an internet gateway.

            The following attributes are supported by only Application Load Balancers:

            - ``idle_timeout.timeout_seconds`` - The idle timeout value, in seconds. The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default is 60 seconds.
            - ``routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode`` - Determines how the load balancer handles requests that might pose a security risk to your application. The possible values are ``monitor`` , ``defensive`` , and ``strictest`` . The default is ``defensive`` .
            - ``routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled`` - Indicates whether HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed by the load balancer ( ``true`` ) or routed to targets ( ``false`` ). The default is ``false`` .
            - ``routing.http.preserve_host_header.enabled`` - Indicates whether the Application Load Balancer should preserve the ``Host`` header in the HTTP request and send it to the target without any change. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .
            - ``routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled`` - Indicates whether the two headers ( ``x-amzn-tls-version`` and ``x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite`` ), which contain information about the negotiated TLS version and cipher suite, are added to the client request before sending it to the target. The ``x-amzn-tls-version`` header has information about the TLS protocol version negotiated with the client, and the ``x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite`` header has information about the cipher suite negotiated with the client. Both headers are in OpenSSL format. The possible values for the attribute are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .
            - ``routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled`` - Indicates whether the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header should preserve the source port that the client used to connect to the load balancer. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .
            - ``routing.http.xff_header_processing.mode`` - Enables you to modify, preserve, or remove the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in the HTTP request before the Application Load Balancer sends the request to the target. The possible values are ``append`` , ``preserve`` , and ``remove`` . The default is ``append`` .
            - If the value is ``append`` , the Application Load Balancer adds the client IP address (of the last hop) to the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in the HTTP request before it sends it to targets.
            - If the value is ``preserve`` the Application Load Balancer preserves the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in the HTTP request, and sends it to targets without any change.
            - If the value is ``remove`` , the Application Load Balancer removes the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header in the HTTP request before it sends it to targets.
            - ``routing.http2.enabled`` - Indicates whether HTTP/2 is enabled. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default is ``true`` . Elastic Load Balancing requires that message header names contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
            - ``waf.fail_open.enabled`` - Indicates whether to allow a WAF-enabled load balancer to route requests to targets if it is unable to forward the request to AWS WAF. The possible values are ``true`` and ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .

        :param load_balancer_attributes: The load balancer attributes.
        :param name: The name of the load balancer. This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, must not begin or end with a hyphen, and must not begin with "internal-". If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID for the load balancer. If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource, but you can perform other updates. To replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param scheme: The nodes of an Internet-facing load balancer have public IP addresses. The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the internet. The nodes of an internal load balancer have only private IP addresses. The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the private IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can route requests only from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer. The default is an Internet-facing load balancer. You cannot specify a scheme for a Gateway Load Balancer.

[Application Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at least two Availability Zones. You cannot specify Elastic IP addresses for your subnets. [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] You must specify one Outpost subnet. [Application Load Balancers on Local Zones] You can specify subnets from one or more Local Zones. [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones. You can specify one Elastic IP address per subnet if you need static IP addresses for your internet-facing load balancer. For internal load balancers, you can specify one private IP address per subnet from the IPv4 range of the subnet. For internet-facing load balancer, you can specify one IPv6 address per subnet. [Gateway Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones. You cannot specify Elastic IP addresses for your subnets.
        :param subnets: The IDs of the public subnets. You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone. You must specify either subnets or subnet mappings, but not both. To specify an Elastic IP address, specify subnet mappings instead of subnets. [Application Load Balancers] You must specify subnets from at least two Availability Zones. [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] You must specify one Outpost subnet. [Application Load Balancers on Local Zones] You can specify subnets from one or more Local Zones. [Network Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones. [Gateway Load Balancers] You can specify subnets from one or more Availability Zones.
        :param tags: The tags to assign to the load balancer.
        :param type: The type of load balancer. The default is ``application`` .

        :param health_check_port: The port the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. If the protocol is HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS, UDP, or TCP_UDP, the default is ``traffic-port`` , which is the port on which each target receives traffic from the load balancer. If the protocol is GENEVE, the default is port 80.
        :param health_check_protocol: The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. For Application Load Balancers, the default is HTTP. For Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, the default is TCP. The TCP protocol is not supported for health checks if the protocol of the target group is HTTP or HTTPS. The GENEVE, TLS, UDP, and TCP_UDP protocols are not supported for health checks.
        :param health_check_timeout_seconds: The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response from a target means a failed health check. The range is 2–120 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of HTTP, the default is 6 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of TCP, TLS or HTTPS, the default is 10 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 5 seconds. If the target type is ``lambda`` , the default is 30 seconds.
        :param healthy_threshold_count: The number of consecutive health check successes required before considering a target healthy. The range is 2-10. If the target group protocol is TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP, TLS, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 5. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 5. If the target type is ``lambda`` , the default is 5.
        :param ip_address_type: The type of IP address used for this target group. The possible values are ``ipv4`` and ``ipv6`` . This is an optional parameter. If not specified, the IP address type defaults to ``ipv4`` .
        :param matcher: [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. For target groups with a protocol of TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP or TLS the range is 200-599. For target groups with a protocol of HTTP or HTTPS, the range is 200-499. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the range is 200-399.
        :param name: The name of the target group. This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen.
        :param port: The port on which the targets receive traffic. This port is used unless you specify a port override when registering the target. If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply. If the protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081.
        :param protocol: The protocol to use for routing traffic to the targets. For Application Load Balancers, the supported protocols are HTTP and HTTPS. For Network Load Balancers, the supported protocols are TCP, TLS, UDP, or TCP_UDP. For Gateway Load Balancers, the supported protocol is GENEVE. A TCP_UDP listener must be associated with a TCP_UDP target group. If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply.
        :param protocol_version: [HTTP/HTTPS protocol] The protocol version. The possible values are ``GRPC`` , ``HTTP1`` , and ``HTTP2`` .
        :param tags: The tags.
        :param target_group_attributes: The attributes.
        :param targets: The targets.
        :param target_type: The type of target that you must specify when registering targets with this target group. You can't specify targets for a target group using more than one target type. - ``instance`` - Register targets by instance ID. This is the default value. - ``ip`` - Register targets by IP address. You can specify IP addresses from the subnets of the virtual private cloud (VPC) for the target group, the RFC 1918 range (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16), and the RFC 6598 range (100.64.0.0/10). You can't specify publicly routable IP addresses. - ``lambda`` - Register a single Lambda function as a target. - ``alb`` - Register a single Application Load Balancer as a target.
        :param unhealthy_threshold_count: The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering a target unhealthy. The range is 2-10. If the target group protocol is TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP, TLS, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 2. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 2. If the target type is ``lambda`` , the default is 5.
        :param vpc_id: The identifier of the virtual private cloud (VPC). If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply. Otherwise, this parameter is required.

The range is 0-3600 seconds. The default value is 300 seconds. If the target is a Lambda function, this attribute is not supported. - ``stickiness.enabled`` - Indicates whether target stickiness is enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . - ``stickiness.type`` - Indicates the type of stickiness. The possible values are: - ``lb_cookie`` and ``app_cookie`` for Application Load Balancers. - ``source_ip`` for Network Load Balancers. - ``source_ip_dest_ip`` and ``source_ip_dest_ip_proto`` for Gateway Load Balancers. The following attributes are supported by Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers: - ``load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled`` - Indicates whether cross zone load balancing is enabled. The value is ``true`` , ``false`` or ``use_load_balancer_configuration`` . The default is ``use_load_balancer_configuration`` . - ``target_group_health.dns_failover.minimum_healthy_targets.count`` - The minimum number of targets that must be healthy. If the number of healthy targets is below this value, mark the zone as unhealthy in DNS, so that traffic is routed only to healthy zones. The possible values are ``off`` or an integer from 1 to the maximum number of targets. The default is ``off`` . - ``target_group_health.dns_failover.minimum_healthy_targets.percentage`` - The minimum percentage of targets that must be healthy. If the percentage of healthy targets is below this value, mark the zone as unhealthy in DNS, so that traffic is routed only to healthy zones. The possible values are ``off`` or an integer from 1 to 100. The default is ``off`` . - ``target_group_health.unhealthy_state_routing.minimum_healthy_targets.count`` - The minimum number of targets that must be healthy. If the number of healthy targets is below this value, send traffic to all targets, including unhealthy targets. The possible values are 1 to the maximum number of targets. The default is 1. - ``target_group_health.unhealthy_state_routing.minimum_healthy_targets.percentage`` - The minimum percentage of targets that must be healthy. If the percentage of healthy targets is below this value, send traffic to all targets, including unhealthy targets. The possible values are ``off`` or an integer from 1 to 100. The default is ``off`` . The following attributes are supported only if the load balancer is an Application Load Balancer and the target is an instance or an IP address: - ``load_balancing.algorithm.type`` - The load balancing algorithm determines how the load balancer selects targets when routing requests. The value is ``round_robin`` or ``least_outstanding_requests`` . The default is ``round_robin`` . - ``slow_start.duration_seconds`` - The time period, in seconds, during which a newly registered target receives an increasing share of the traffic to the target group. After this time period ends, the target receives its full share of traffic. The range is 30-900 seconds (15 minutes). The default is 0 seconds (disabled). - ``stickiness.app_cookie.cookie_name`` - Indicates the name of the application-based cookie. Names that start with the following prefixes are not allowed: ``AWSALB`` , ``AWSALBAPP`` , and ``AWSALBTG`` ; they're reserved for use by the load balancer. - ``stickiness.app_cookie.duration_seconds`` - The time period, in seconds, during which requests from a client should be routed to the same target. After this time period expires, the application-based cookie is considered stale. The range is 1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default value is 1 day (86400 seconds). - ``stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds`` - The time period, in seconds, during which requests from a client should be routed to the same target. After this time period expires, the load balancer-generated cookie is considered stale. The range is 1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default value is 1 day (86400 seconds). The following attribute is supported only if the load balancer is an Application Load Balancer and the target is a Lambda function: - ``lambda.multi_value_headers.enabled`` - Indicates whether the request and response headers that are exchanged between the load balancer and the Lambda function include arrays of values or strings. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . If the value is ``false`` and the request contains a duplicate header field name or query parameter key, the load balancer uses the last value sent by the client. The following attributes are supported only by Network Load Balancers: - ``deregistration_delay.connection_termination.enabled`` - Indicates whether the load balancer terminates connections at the end of the deregistration timeout. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . - ``preserve_client_ip.enabled`` - Indicates whether client IP preservation is enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is disabled if the target group type is IP address and the target group protocol is TCP or TLS. Otherwise, the default is enabled. Client IP preservation cannot be disabled for UDP and TCP_UDP target groups. - ``proxy_protocol_v2.enabled`` - Indicates whether Proxy Protocol version 2 is enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . The following attributes are supported only by Gateway Load Balancers: - ``target_failover.on_deregistration`` - Indicates how the Gateway Load Balancer handles existing flows when a target is deregistered. The possible values are ``rebalance`` and ``no_rebalance`` . The default is ``no_rebalance`` . The two attributes ( ``target_failover.on_deregistration`` and ``target_failover.on_unhealthy`` ) can't be set independently. The value you set for both attributes must be the same. - ``target_failover.on_unhealthy`` - Indicates how the Gateway Load Balancer handles existing flows when a target is unhealthy. The possible values are ``rebalance`` and ``no_rebalance`` . The default is ``no_rebalance`` . The two attributes ( ``target_failover.on_deregistration`` and ``target_failover.on_unhealthy`` ) cannot be set independently. The value you set for both attributes must be the same.

            The following attributes are supported by all load balancers:

            - ``deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds`` - The amount of time, in seconds, for Elastic Load Balancing to wait before changing the state of a deregistering target from ``draining`` to ``unused`` . The range is 0-3600 seconds. The default value is 300 seconds. If the target is a Lambda function, this attribute is not supported.
            - ``stickiness.enabled`` - Indicates whether target stickiness is enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .
            - ``stickiness.type`` - Indicates the type of stickiness. The possible values are:
            - ``lb_cookie`` and ``app_cookie`` for Application Load Balancers.
            - ``source_ip`` for Network Load Balancers.
            - ``source_ip_dest_ip`` and ``source_ip_dest_ip_proto`` for Gateway Load Balancers.

            The following attributes are supported by Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

            - ``load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled`` - Indicates whether cross zone load balancing is enabled. The value is ``true`` , ``false`` or ``use_load_balancer_configuration`` . The default is ``use_load_balancer_configuration`` .
            - ``target_group_health.dns_failover.minimum_healthy_targets.count`` - The minimum number of targets that must be healthy. If the number of healthy targets is below this value, mark the zone as unhealthy in DNS, so that traffic is routed only to healthy zones. The possible values are ``off`` or an integer from 1 to the maximum number of targets. The default is ``off`` .
            - ``target_group_health.dns_failover.minimum_healthy_targets.percentage`` - The minimum percentage of targets that must be healthy. If the percentage of healthy targets is below this value, mark the zone as unhealthy in DNS, so that traffic is routed only to healthy zones. The possible values are ``off`` or an integer from 1 to 100. The default is ``off`` .
            - ``target_group_health.unhealthy_state_routing.minimum_healthy_targets.count`` - The minimum number of targets that must be healthy. If the number of healthy targets is below this value, send traffic to all targets, including unhealthy targets. The possible values are 1 to the maximum number of targets. The default is 1.
            - ``target_group_health.unhealthy_state_routing.minimum_healthy_targets.percentage`` - The minimum percentage of targets that must be healthy. If the percentage of healthy targets is below this value, send traffic to all targets, including unhealthy targets. The possible values are ``off`` or an integer from 1 to 100. The default is ``off`` .

            The following attributes are supported only if the load balancer is an Application Load Balancer and the target is an instance or an IP address:

            - ``load_balancing.algorithm.type`` - The load balancing algorithm determines how the load balancer selects targets when routing requests. The value is ``round_robin`` or ``least_outstanding_requests`` . The default is ``round_robin`` .
            - ``slow_start.duration_seconds`` - The time period, in seconds, during which a newly registered target receives an increasing share of the traffic to the target group. After this time period ends, the target receives its full share of traffic. The range is 30-900 seconds (15 minutes). The default is 0 seconds (disabled).
            - ``stickiness.app_cookie.cookie_name`` - Indicates the name of the application-based cookie. Names that start with the following prefixes are not allowed: ``AWSALB`` , ``AWSALBAPP`` , and ``AWSALBTG`` ; they're reserved for use by the load balancer.
            - ``stickiness.app_cookie.duration_seconds`` - The time period, in seconds, during which requests from a client should be routed to the same target. After this time period expires, the application-based cookie is considered stale. The range is 1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default value is 1 day (86400 seconds).
            - ``stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds`` - The time period, in seconds, during which requests from a client should be routed to the same target. After this time period expires, the load balancer-generated cookie is considered stale. The range is 1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default value is 1 day (86400 seconds).

            The following attribute is supported only if the load balancer is an Application Load Balancer and the target is a Lambda function:

            - ``lambda.multi_value_headers.enabled`` - Indicates whether the request and response headers that are exchanged between the load balancer and the Lambda function include arrays of values or strings. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` . If the value is ``false`` and the request contains a duplicate header field name or query parameter key, the load balancer uses the last value sent by the client.

            The following attributes are supported only by Network Load Balancers:

            - ``deregistration_delay.connection_termination.enabled`` - Indicates whether the load balancer terminates connections at the end of the deregistration timeout. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .
            - ``preserve_client_ip.enabled`` - Indicates whether client IP preservation is enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is disabled if the target group type is IP address and the target group protocol is TCP or TLS. Otherwise, the default is enabled. Client IP preservation cannot be disabled for UDP and TCP_UDP target groups.
            - ``proxy_protocol_v2.enabled`` - Indicates whether Proxy Protocol version 2 is enabled. The value is ``true`` or ``false`` . The default is ``false`` .

            The following attributes are supported only by Gateway Load Balancers:

            - ``target_failover.on_deregistration`` - Indicates how the Gateway Load Balancer handles existing flows when a target is deregistered. The possible values are ``rebalance`` and ``no_rebalance`` . The default is ``no_rebalance`` . The two attributes ( ``target_failover.on_deregistration`` and ``target_failover.on_unhealthy`` ) can't be set independently. The value you set for both attributes must be the same.
            - ``target_failover.on_unhealthy`` - Indicates how the Gateway Load Balancer handles existing flows when a target is unhealthy. The possible values are ``rebalance`` and ``no_rebalance`` . The default is ``no_rebalance`` . The two attributes ( ``target_failover.on_deregistration`` and ``target_failover.on_unhealthy`` ) cannot be set independently. The value you set for both attributes must be the same.

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnTargetGroup``.

        :param health_check_enabled: Indicates whether health checks are enabled. If the target type is ``lambda`` , health checks are disabled by default but can be enabled. If the target type is ``instance`` , ``ip`` , or ``alb`` , health checks are always enabled and cannot be disabled.
        :param health_check_interval_seconds: The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. The range is 5-300. If the target group protocol is TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP_UDP, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 30 seconds. If the target group protocol is GENEVE, the default is 10 seconds. If the target type is ``lambda`` , the default is 35 seconds.
        :param health_check_path: [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The destination for health checks on the targets. [HTTP1 or HTTP2 protocol version] The ping path. The default is /. [GRPC protocol version] The path of a custom health check method with the format /package.service/method. The default is / AWS .ALB/healthcheck.
        :param health_check_port: The port the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. If the protocol is HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS, UDP, or TCP_UDP, the default is ``traffic-port`` , which is the port on which each target receives traffic from the load balancer. If the protocol is GENEVE, the default is port 80.
        :param health_check_protocol: The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. For Application Load Balancers, the default is HTTP.

The GENEVE, TLS, UDP, and TCP_UDP protocols are not supported for health checks.
        :param health_check_timeout_seconds: The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response from a target means a failed health check. The range is 2–120 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of HTTP, the default is 6 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of TCP, TLS or HTTPS, the default is 10 seconds. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 5 seconds. If the target type is ``lambda`` , the default is 30 seconds.
        :param healthy_threshold_count: The number of consecutive health check successes required before considering a target healthy. The range is 2-10. If the target group protocol is TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP, TLS, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 5. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 5. If the target type is ``lambda`` , the default is 5.
        :param ip_address_type: The type of IP address used for this target group. The possible values are ``ipv4`` and ``ipv6`` . This is an optional parameter. If not specified, the IP address type defaults to ``ipv4`` .
        :param matcher: [HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. For target groups with a protocol of TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP or TLS the range is 200-599. For target groups with a protocol of HTTP or HTTPS, the range is 200-499. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the range is 200-399.
        :param name: The name of the target group. This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen.
        :param port: The port on which the targets receive traffic. This port is used unless you specify a port override when registering the target. If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply. If the protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081.
        :param protocol: The protocol to use for routing traffic to the targets. For Application Load Balancers, the supported protocols are HTTP and HTTPS. For Network Load Balancers, the supported protocols are TCP, TLS, UDP, or TCP_UDP. For Gateway Load Balancers, the supported protocol is GENEVE. A TCP_UDP listener must be associated with a TCP_UDP target group. If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply.
        :param protocol_version: [HTTP/HTTPS protocol] The protocol version. The possible values are ``GRPC`` , ``HTTP1`` , and ``HTTP2`` .
        :param tags: The tags.
        :param target_group_attributes: The attributes.
        :param targets: The targets.
        :param target_type: The type of target that you must specify when registering targets with this target group. You can't specify targets for a target group using more than one target type. - ``instance`` - Register targets by instance ID. This is the default value. - ``ip`` - Register targets by IP address. You can specify IP addresses from the subnets of the virtual private cloud (VPC) for the target group, the RFC 1918 range (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16), and the RFC 6598 range (100.64.0.0/10). You can't specify publicly routable IP addresses. - ``lambda`` - Register a single Lambda function as a target. - ``alb`` - Register a single Application Load Balancer as a target.
        :param unhealthy_threshold_count: The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering a target unhealthy. The range is 2-10. If the target group protocol is TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP, TLS, HTTP or HTTPS, the default is 2. For target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the default is 2. If the target type is ``lambda`` , the default is 5.
        :param vpc_id: The identifier of the virtual private cloud (VPC). If the target is a Lambda function, this parameter does not apply. Otherwise, this parameter is required.

        This method implicitly creates an ApplicationTargetGroup for the targets
        involved, and a 'forward' action to route traffic to the given TargetGroup.

        If you want more control over the precise setup, create the TargetGroup
        and use ``addAction`` yourself.

        It's possible to add conditions to the targets added in this way. At least
        one set of targets must be added without conditions.

        :param id: -
        :param deregistration_delay: (experimental) The amount of time for Elastic Load Balancing to wait before deregistering a target. The range is 0-3600 seconds. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param health_check: (experimental) Health check configuration. Default: - The default value for each property in this configuration varies depending on the target.
        :param load_balancing_algorithm_type: (experimental) The load balancing algorithm to select targets for routing requests. Default: round_robin.
        :param port: (experimental) The port on which the listener listens for requests. Default: Determined from protocol if known

        :param protocol_version: (experimental) The protocol version to use. Default: ApplicationProtocolVersion.HTTP1
        :param slow_start: (experimental) The time period during which the load balancer sends a newly registered target a linearly increasing share of the traffic to the target group. The range is 30-900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0
        :param stickiness_cookie_duration: (experimental) The stickiness cookie expiration period. Setting this value enables load balancer stickiness. After this period, the cookie is considered stale. The minimum value is 1 second and the maximum value is 7 days (604800 seconds). Default: Stickiness disabled
        :param stickiness_cookie_name: (experimental) The name of an application-based stickiness cookie. Names that start with the following prefixes are not allowed: AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, and AWSALBTG; they're reserved for use by the load balancer. Note: ``stickinessCookieName`` parameter depends on the presence of ``stickinessCookieDuration`` parameter. If ``stickinessCookieDuration`` is not set, ``stickinessCookieName`` will be omitted. Default: - If ``stickinessCookieDuration`` is set, a load-balancer generated cookie is used. Otherwise, no stickiness is defined.
        :param target_group_name: (experimental) The name of the target group. This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen. Default: Automatically generated
        :param targets: (experimental) The targets to add to this target group. Can be ``Instance``, ``IPAddress``, or any self-registering load balancing target. All target must be of the same type.
        :param conditions: (experimental) Rule applies if matches the conditions. Default: - No conditions.
        :param host_header: (deprecated) Rule applies if the requested host matches the indicated host. May contain up to three '*' wildcards. Requires that priority is set. Default: No host condition

# Kinesis Analytics Flink

This package provides constructs for creating Kinesis Analytics Flink
applications. To learn more about using using managed Flink applications, see
the [AWS developer
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/).

## Creating Flink Applications

To create a new Flink application, use the `Application` construct:

```python
import path as path
import monocdk as core
import monocdk as flink
import monocdk.aws_cloudwatch as cloudwatch

app = core.App()
stack = core.Stack(app, "FlinkAppTest")

flink_app = flink.Application(stack, "App",
    code=flink.ApplicationCode.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "code-asset")),
    runtime=flink.Runtime.FLINK_1_11
)

cloudwatch.Alarm(stack, "Alarm",
    metric=flink_app.metric_full_restarts(),
    evaluation_periods=1,
    threshold=3
)

app.synth()
```

The `code` property can use `fromAsset` as shown above to reference a local jar
file in s3 or `fromBucket` to reference a file in s3.

```python
import path as path
import monocdk.aws_s3_assets as assets
import monocdk as core
import monocdk as flink

app = core.App()
stack = core.Stack(app, "FlinkAppCodeFromBucketTest")

asset = assets.Asset(stack, "CodeAsset",
    path=path.join(__dirname, "code-asset")
)
bucket = asset.bucket
file_key = asset.s3_object_key

flink.Application(stack, "App",
    code=flink.ApplicationCode.from_bucket(bucket, file_key),
    runtime=flink.Runtime.FLINK_1_11
)

app.synth()
```

The `propertyGroups` property provides a way of passing arbitrary runtime
properties to your Flink application. You can use the
aws-kinesisanalytics-runtime library to [retrieve these
properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/how-properties.html#how-properties-access).

```python
# bucket: s3.Bucket

flink_app = flink.Application(self, "Application",
    property_groups=flink.aws_kinesisanalytics_flink.PropertyGroups(
        FlinkApplicationProperties={
            "input_stream_name": "my-input-kinesis-stream",
            "output_stream_name": "my-output-kinesis-stream"
        }
    ),
    # ...
    runtime=flink.Runtime.FLINK_1_13,
    code=flink.ApplicationCode.from_bucket(bucket, "my-app.jar")
)
```

Flink applications also have specific configuration for passing parameters
when the Flink job starts. These include parameters for checkpointing,
snapshotting, monitoring, and parallelism.

```python
# bucket: s3.Bucket

flink_app = flink.Application(self, "Application",
    code=flink.ApplicationCode.from_bucket(bucket, "my-app.jar"),
    runtime=flink.Runtime.FLINK_1_13,
    checkpointing_enabled=True,  # default is true
    checkpoint_interval=Duration.seconds(30),  # default is 1 minute
    min_pause_between_checkpoints=Duration.seconds(10),  # default is 5 seconds
    log_level=flink.LogLevel.ERROR,  # default is INFO
    metrics_level=flink.MetricsLevel.PARALLELISM,  # default is APPLICATION
    auto_scaling_enabled=False,  # default is true
    parallelism=32,  # default is 1
    parallelism_per_kpu=2,  # default is 1
    snapshots_enabled=False,  # default is true
    log_group=logs.LogGroup(self, "LogGroup")
)
```

        :param color: (experimental) The hex color code, prefixed with '#' (e.g. '#00ff00'), to use when this metric is rendered on a graph. The ``Color`` class has a set of standard colors that can be used here. Default: - Automatic color

        :param dimensions_map: (experimental) Dimensions of the metric. Default: - No dimensions.
        :param label: (experimental) Label for this metric when added to a Graph in a Dashboard. You can use `dynamic labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`_ to show summary information about the entire displayed time series in the legend. For example, if you use:: [max: ${MAX}] MyMetric As the metric label, the maximum value in the visible range will be shown next to the time series name in the graph's legend. Default: - No label
        :param period: (experimental) The period over which the specified statistic is applied. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param region: (experimental) Region which this metric comes from. Default: - Deployment region.
        :param statistic: (experimental) What function to use for aggregating. Can be one of the following: - "Minimum" | "min" - "Maximum" | "max" - "Average" | "avg" - "Sum" | "sum" - "SampleCount | "n" - "pNN.NN" Default: Average
        :param unit: (experimental) Unit used to filter the metric stream. Only refer to datums emitted to the metric stream with the given unit and ignore all others. Only useful when datums are being emitted to the same metric stream under different units. The default is to use all matric datums in the stream, regardless of unit, which is recommended in nearly all cases. CloudWatch does not honor this property for graphs. Default: - All metric datums in the given metric stream

# NanoQNTPy
This software is used to analyze the data generated by the nanoQNT device from Dispertech. 

In a nutshell, it uses Trackpy to localize and link bright spots on a series of images acquired with 
a light-sheet microscope. In case of multi-colour images, it uses KD-Tree's to cross-link the particles 
and measure the fluorescence intensity in each one. 

## Requirements
Important requirements for the program:

**Python 3.9+** is required, lower versions will have issues saving the data. 
**Numba** is required to speed up the analysis. 

## Work in Progress
This program is work in progress and subject to change without prior notice.

# Euroleague API

This is a python package of the Euroleague API. The API endpoints were found on the [swagger platform](https://api-live.euroleague.net/swagger/index.html), with the addition of a few more API endpoints (e.g. shot data) found on blogs and discussions. More endpoints will be added.

TODO:
- publish on pypi. Until package is published, clone the repo and run
  ```
  cd <path to repo>
  pip install -e .
  ```
- tests

from euroleague_api import shot_data

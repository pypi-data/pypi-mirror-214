This is a package to allow testing of discord.py.
It is only compatible with the rewrite version, and is still in alpha.
If using pytest, it is suggested to use pytest-asyncio for test running, otherwise the user will need
to provide their own async test runner.

## Notice

For discord.py 1.7.X, use `dpytest 0.5.3`

For discord.py 2.X.X, use `dpytest>=0.6`

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at [dpytest.readthedocs.io](https://dpytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), including examples and tutorials

# History

## 0.7.0

⚠️ Warning ⚠️:

This can be **breaking** :

The `configure` function has changed.
It nows accepts either an `int` (like in the previous version) OR a `list` of `string` for the parameters `guilds`, `text_channels`, `voice_channels` and `members`.
But the names of the parameters had to be changed.

`num_guilds`, `num_text_channels`, `num_voice_channels`, `num_members` are DERECATED.

Example:

```python
    dpytest.configure(bot,
                      guilds=["CoolGuild", "LameGuild"],
                      text_channels=["Fruits", "Videogames"],
                      voice_channels=2,
                      members=["Joe", "Jack", "William", "Averell"])
```

Other changes:

- fixes in typing
- add `content_type` to `dict_from_attachment()`

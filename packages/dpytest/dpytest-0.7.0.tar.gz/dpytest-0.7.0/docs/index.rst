Welcome to the dpytest documentation!
=====================================

The ``dpytest`` library is designed to make testing of discord bots easy and painless.

The library is currently in its infancy, and only supports a subset of the discord API.
Also, the API is not yet finalized, and may change somewhat rapidly. Breaking changes can be
expected until the library hits version 1.0.

This is a package to allow testing of discord.py.
It is only compatible with the rewrite version, and is still in alpha.
If using pytest, it is suggested to use pytest-asyncio for test running, otherwise the user will need
to provide their own async test runner.

## Notice

For discord.py 1.7.X, use `dpytest 0.5.3`

For discord.py 2.X.X, use `dpytest>=0.6`

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at [dpytest.readthedocs.io](https://dpytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), including examples and tutorials

MAGNETO: Marker pAnels GeNEraTor with multi-Objective optimization

MAGNETO is a user-friendly and fully-automatic framework that exploits Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOAEs) to solve a tailored bi-objective optimization problem, specifically designed to build effective marker panels.
MAGNETO can thus help researchers to identify the most promising marker panels, starting from a gene expression matrix with single-cell resolution data and a cell type identity for each cell.

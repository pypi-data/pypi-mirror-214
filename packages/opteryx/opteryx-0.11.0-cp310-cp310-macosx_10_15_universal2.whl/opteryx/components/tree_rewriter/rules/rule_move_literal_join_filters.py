    This action aims to move any filters in JOIN ON conditions which are referencing
    literals and therefore aren't actually a join condition.

    If the condition doesn't have a literal, then we assume it's a join condition.

    When we remove the filters, we put them after the join - this is always correct
    but non-optimal, that's fine we should let the optimizer work out where to filter.

Optimization Rule - Predicate Pushdown

Type: Heuristic
Goal: Reduce rows

def predicate_pushdown(plan, properties):
    """
    Initial implementation of Predicate Pushdown, this puts selections (filters) as
    close to the read as possible, including offloading them to external services.

    This has the benefit that we have less data to pass around the system, and
    where we can offload to other systems (e.g. FireStore) we don't need to
    transport that data over the network.

    We do this work by removing the selection node from the query plan and adding
    it to the filter in the reader node.

    This initial implementation has a lot of limitations:

    - only a single reader can exist in the plan
    - only some readers support pushdown
    - no GROUP BY / Aggregate can exist in the plan

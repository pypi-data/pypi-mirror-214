"""
This builds a logical plan can resolve the query from the user.

This doesn't attempt to do optimization, this just build a convenient plan which will
respond to the query correctly.

The effective order of operations must be:

    01. FROM
    02. JOIN
    03. WHERE
    04. GROUP BY
    05. HAVING
    06. SELECT
    07. DISTINCT
    08. ORDER BY
    09. OFFSET
    10. LIMIT

So we just build it in that order.

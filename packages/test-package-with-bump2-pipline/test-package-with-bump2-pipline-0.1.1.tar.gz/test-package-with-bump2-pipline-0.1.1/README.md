# bump2-auto-build-and-update

Instead of using github template pipline for publishing Python package,
this pipline is automated for build/updating your Python packages.

So, you won't need it to manually update package version everytime when you push new changes.

By default for just testing purposes, I will leave it on push requests,
but you can change it as you wish.

just be sure, that you have correct secret variables set up on your repository, as it is in pipline file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBtap2sna.py\fP converts a TAP or TZX file (which may be inside a zip archive)
into a Z80 snapshot. INPUT may be the full URL to a remote zip archive or
TAP/TZX file, or the path to a local file. Arguments may be read from FILE
instead of (or as well as) being given on the command line.

.SH TZX SUPPORT
.sp
\fBtap2sna.py\fP can read data from TZX block types 0x10 (standard speed data),
0x11 (turbo speed data) and 0x14 (pure data), but not block types 0x15 (direct
recording), 0x18 (CSW recording) or 0x19 (generalized data block).
.SH SIMULATED LOAD
.sp
The \fB\-\-sim\-load\fP option simulates a freshly booted 48K ZX Spectrum running
LOAD "" (or LOAD ""CODE, if the first block on the tape is a \(aqBytes\(aq header).
Whenever the Spectrum ROM\(aqs load routine at $0556 is called, a shortcut is
taken by "fast loading" the next block on the tape. All other code (including
any custom loader) is fully simulated. Simulation continues until the program
counter hits the start address given by the \fB\-\-start\fP option, or 15 minutes
of simulated Z80 CPU time has elapsed, or the end of the tape is reached and
one of the following conditions is satisfied:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a custom loader was detected
.IP \(bu 2
the program counter hits an address outside the ROM
.IP \(bu 2
more than one second of simulated Z80 CPU time has elapsed since the end of
the tape was reached
.UNINDENT
.sp
A simulated LOAD can also be aborted by pressing Ctrl\-C. When a simulated LOAD
has completed or been aborted, the values of the registers (including the
program counter) in the simulator are used to populate the Z80 snapshot.
.sp
A simulated LOAD can be configured via parameters that are set by the
by the \fB\-\-sim\-load\-config\fP (or \fB\-c\fP) option. The recognised configuration
parameters are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBaccelerate\-dec\-a\fP \- enable acceleration of \(aqDEC A: JR NZ,$\-1\(aq delay loops
(\fB1\fP, the default), or \(aqDEC A: JP NZ,$\-1\(aq delay loops (\fB2\fP), or neither
(\fB0\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBaccelerator\fP \- a comma\-separated list of tape\-sampling loop accelerators
to use (see below)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcontended\-in\fP \- interpret \(aqIN A,($FE)\(aq instructions in the address range
$4000\-$7FFF as reading the tape (\fB1\fP), or ignore them (\fB0\fP, the default)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfast\-load\fP \- enable fast loading (\fB1\fP, the default), or disable it
(\fB0\fP); fast loading significantly reduces the load time for many tapes, but
can also cause some loaders to fail
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfinish\-tape\fP \- run the tape to the end before stopping the simulation at
the address specified by the \fB\-\-start\fP option (\fB1\fP), or stop the
simulation as soon as that address is reached, regardless of whether the tape
has finished (\fB0\fP, the default)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfirst\-edge\fP \- the time (in T\-states) from the start of the tape at which
to place the leading edge of the first pulse (default: \fB\-2168\fP); the
default value places the trailing edge of the first pulse at time 0, but some
loaders (e.g. polarity\-sensitive loaders) require \fBfirst\-edge=0\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpause\fP \- pause the tape between blocks and resume playback when port 254
is read (\fB1\fP, the default), or run the tape continuously (\fB0\fP); pausing
can help with tapes that require (but do not actually contain) long pauses
between blocks, but can cause some loaders to fail
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtimeout\fP \- the number of seconds of Z80 CPU time after which to abort the
simulated LOAD if it\(aqs still in progress (default: 900)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtrace\fP \- the file to which to log all instructions executed during the
simulated LOAD (default: none)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBaccelerator\fP parameter must be either a comma\-separated list of specific
accelerator names or one of the following special values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBauto\fP \- select accelerators automatically (this is the default)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlist\fP \- list the accelerators used during a simulated LOAD, along with the
hit/miss counts generated by the tape\-sampling loop detector
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP \- disable acceleration; the loading time for a game with a custom
loader that uses an unrecognised tape\-sampling loop may be reduced by
specifying this value
.UNINDENT
.sp
The output produced by \fBaccelerator=list\fP looks something like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Accelerators: microsphere: 6695; rom: 794013; misses: 19/9
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This means that the \fBmicrosphere\fP and \fBrom\fP tape\-sampling loops were
detected, and were entered 6695 times and 794013 times respectively. In
addition, 19 instances of \(aqINC B\(aq outside a tape\-sampling loop were executed,
and the corresponding figure for \(aqDEC B\(aq is 9.
.sp
Specifying by name the types of tape\-sampling loop used by a game\(aqs custom
loader may reduce the loading time. The names of the available tape\-sampling
loop accelerators are:

.SH CALL OPERATIONS
.sp
The \fB\-\-ram\fP option can be used to call a Python function to perform arbitrary
modification of the memory snapshot.
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram call=[/path/to/moduledir:]module.function\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
The function is called with the memory snapshot (a list of 65536 byte values)
as the sole positional argument. The function must modify the snapshot in
place. The path to the module\(aqs location may be omitted if the module is
already in the module search path.
.sp
For example:
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram call=:ram.modify\fP # Call modify(snapshot) in ./ram.py
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.SH LOAD OPERATIONS
.sp
By default, \fBtap2sna.py\fP loads bytes from every data block on the tape, using
the start address given in the corresponding header. For tapes that contain
headerless data blocks, headers with incorrect start addresses, or irrelevant
blocks, the \fB\-\-ram\fP option can be used to load bytes from specific blocks at
the appropriate addresses. The syntax is:
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram load=[+]block[+],start[,length,step,offset,inc]\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
where the parameters have the following meanings:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBblock\fP
The tape block number; the first block is 1, the next is 2, etc. Attach a \(aq+\(aq
prefix to load the first byte of the block (which is usually the flag byte),
and a \(aq+\(aq suffix to load the last byte (which is usually the parity byte).
.TP
.B \fBstart\fP
The destination address at which to start loading.
.TP
.B \fBlength\fP
The number of bytes to load (optional; defaults to the number of bytes
remaining in the block).
.TP
.B \fBstep\fP
This number is added to the destination address after each byte is loaded
(optional; default=1).
.TP
.B \fBoffset\fP
This number is added to the destination address before a byte is loaded, and
subtracted after the byte is loaded (optional; default=0). It is analogous to
the offset \fBd\fP in the \fBLD (IX+d),L\fP operation that is commonly used in
load routines to copy the byte just loaded from tape (\fBL\fP) into memory.
.TP
.B \fBinc\fP
After \fBstep\fP is added to the destination address, this number is added too
if the result overflowed past 65535 (optional; default=0).
.UNINDENT
.sp
A single tape block can be loaded in two or more stages; for example:
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram load=2,32768,2048\fP # Load the first 2K at 32768
\fB\-\-ram load=2,0xC000\fP     # Load the remainder at 49152
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.SH MOVE OPERATIONS
.sp
The \fB\-\-ram\fP option can be used to move a block of bytes from one location to
another before saving the snapshot.
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram move=src,N,dest\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
This moves a block of \fBN\fP bytes from \fBsrc\fP to \fBdest\fP\&. For example:
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram move=32512,256,32768\fP     # Move 32512\-32767 to 32768\-33023
\fB\-\-ram move=0x9c00,0x100,0x9d00\fP # Move 39936\-40191 to 40192\-40447
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.SH POKE OPERATIONS
.sp
The \fB\-\-ram\fP option can be used to POKE values into the snapshot before saving
it.
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram poke=A[\-B[\-C]],[^+]V\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
This does \fBPOKE N,V\fP for \fBN\fP in \fB{A, A+C, A+2C..., B}\fP, where:
.sp
\fBA\fP is the first address to POKE
.sp
\fBB\fP is the last address to POKE (optional; default is \fBA\fP)
.sp
\fBC\fP is the step (optional; default=1)
.sp
\fBV\fP is the value to POKE; prefix the value with \(aq^\(aq to perform an XOR
operation, or \(aq+\(aq to perform an ADD operation
.sp
For example:
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram poke=0x6000,0x10\fP     # POKE 24576,16
\fB\-\-ram poke=30000\-30002,^85\fP # Perform \(aqXOR 85\(aq on addresses 30000\-30002
\fB\-\-ram poke=40000\-40004\-2,1\fP # POKE 40000,1: POKE 40002,1: POKE 40004,1
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.SH SYSVARS OPERATION
.sp
The \fB\-\-ram\fP option can be used to initialise the system variables at
23552\-23754 (5C00\-5CCA) with values suitable for a 48K ZX Spectrum.
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-ram sysvars\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.SH REGISTERS
.sp
The \fB\-\-reg\fP option sets the value of a register in the snapshot.
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-reg name=value\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
For example:
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-reg hl=32768\fP
\fB\-\-reg b=0x1f\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
To set the value of an alternate (shadow) register, use the \(aq^\(aq prefix:
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-reg ^hl=10072\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
Recognised register names are:
.nf

.in +2
\fB^a\fP, \fB^b\fP, \fB^bc\fP, \fB^c\fP, \fB^d\fP, \fB^de\fP, \fB^e\fP, \fB^f\fP, \fB^h\fP, \fB^hl\fP, \fB^l\fP,
\fBa\fP, \fBb\fP, \fBbc\fP, \fBc\fP, \fBd\fP, \fBde\fP, \fBe\fP, \fBf\fP, \fBh\fP, \fBhl\fP, \fBl\fP,
\fBi\fP, \fBix\fP, \fBiy\fP, \fBpc\fP, \fBr\fP, \fBsp\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
The default value for each register is 0, with the following exceptions:
.nf

.in +2
\fBi=63\fP
\fBiy=23610\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.SH HARDWARE STATE
.sp
The \fB\-\-state\fP option sets a hardware state attribute.
.nf

.in +2
\fB\-\-state name=value\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
Recognised attribute names and their default values are:
.nf

.in +2
\fBborder\fP  \- border colour (default=0)
\fBiff\fP     \- interrupt flip\-flop: 0=disabled, 1=enabled (default=1)
\fBim\fP      \- interrupt mode (default=1)
\fBissue2\fP  \- issue 2 emulation: 0=disabled, 1=enabled (default=0)
\fBtstates\fP \- T\-states elapsed since start of frame (default=34943)
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.SH READING ARGUMENTS FROM A FILE
.sp
For complex snapshots that require many \fB\-\-ram\fP, \fB\-\-reg\fP or \fB\-\-state\fP
options to build, it may be more convenient to store the arguments to
\fBtap2sna.py\fP in a file. For example, if the file \fBgame.t2s\fP has the
following contents:
.nf

.in +2
;
; tap2sna.py file for GAME
;
http://example.com/pub/games/GAME.zip
game.z80
\-\-ram load=4,32768         # Load the fourth block at 32768
\-\-ram move=40960,512,43520 # Move 40960\-41471 to 43520\-44031
\-\-ram call=:ram.modify     # Call modify(snapshot) in ./ram.py
\-\-ram sysvars              # Initialise the system variables
\-\-state iff=0              # Disable interrupts
\-\-stack 32768              # Stack at 32768
\-\-start 34816              # Start at 34816
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
then:
.nf

.in +2
\fBtap2sna.py @game.t2s\fP
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
will create \fBgame.z80\fP as if the arguments specified in \fBgame.t2s\fP had been
given on the command line.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
\fBtap2sna.py\fP will read configuration from a file named \fBskoolkit.ini\fP in
the current working directory or in \fB~/.skoolkit\fP, if present. The recognised
configuration parameters are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B TraceLine
The format of each line in the trace log file for a simulated
LOAD (default: \fB${pc:04X} {i}\fP).
.TP
.B TraceOperand
The prefix, byte format, and word format for the numeric
operands of instructions in the trace log file for a simulated LOAD,
separated by commas (default: \fB$,02X,04X\fP). The byte and word formats are
standard Python format specifiers for numeric values, and default to empty
strings if not supplied.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBTraceLine\fP is a standard Python format string that recognises the following
replacement fields:
.nf

.in +2
\fBi\fP  \- the current instruction
\fBpc\fP \- the address of the current instruction (program counter)
\fBr[a]\fP \- the A register (accumulator)
\fBr[f]\fP \- the F (flags) register
\fBr[b]\fP \- the B register
\fBr[c]\fP \- the C register
\fBr[d]\fP \- the D register
\fBr[e]\fP \- the E register
\fBr[h]\fP \- the H register
\fBr[l]\fP \- the L register
\fBr[^a]\fP \- the A\(aq register (shadow accumulator)
\fBr[^f]\fP \- the F\(aq (shadow flags) register
\fBr[^b]\fP \- the shadow B register
\fBr[^c]\fP \- the shadow C register
\fBr[^d]\fP \- the shadow D register
\fBr[^e]\fP \- the shadow E register
\fBr[^h]\fP \- the shadow H register
\fBr[^l]\fP \- the shadow L register
\fBr[ixh]\fP \- the high byte of the IX register pair
\fBr[ixl]\fP \- the low byte of the IX register pair
\fBr[iyh]\fP \- the high byte of the IY register pair
\fBr[iyl]\fP \- the low byte of the IY register pair
\fBr[i]\fP \- the I register
\fBr[r]\fP \- the R register
\fBr[sp]\fP \- the stack pointer
\fBr[t]\fP \- the current timestamp
.in -2
.fi
.sp
.sp
The current timestamp (\fBr[t]\fP) is the number of T\-states that have elapsed
since the start of the simulation, according to the simulator\(aqs internal clock.
In order to maintain synchronisation with the tape being loaded, the
simulator\(aqs clock is adjusted to match the timestamp of the first pulse in each
block (as shown by the \fB\-\-tape\-analysis\fP option) when that block is reached.
(The simulator\(aqs clock may at times become desynchronised with the tape
because, by default, the tape is paused between blocks, and resumed when port
254 is read.)
.sp
Configuration parameters must appear in a \fB[tap2sna]\fP section. For example,
to make \fBtap2sna.py\fP write instruction addresses and operands in a trace log
file in decimal format by default, add the following section to
\fBskoolkit.ini\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

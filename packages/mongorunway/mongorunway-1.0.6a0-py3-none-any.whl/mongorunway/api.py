    Creates a migration application based on the provided parameters.
    Uses a use case to initialize the application configuration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the application for which the creation options will
        be taken from the configuration file. The application name should
        match the application name in the configuration file.
    configuration : typing.Optional[typing.Union[os.PathLike[str], str, pathlib.Path, config.Config]]
        The path to the configuration file or the configuration object
        required for initializing the application.
    raise_on_none : bool, optional
        By default, the use-cases return None and do not raise exceptions.
        If `raise_on_none` is True, an exception will be raised on a failed
        attempt to initialize the application.
    verbose_exc : bool, optional
        In case of an exception being raised on a failed attempt to initialize
        the application, the exception information will be more detailed if
        `verbose_exc` is True.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If `raise_on_none` is True and the initialization of the application fails,
        this exception will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    typing.Union[MigrationApp, typing.Optional[MigrationApp]]
        If `raise_on_none` is True, an application object is guaranteed to be
        returned or an exception is raised. Otherwise, if the application
        initialization fails, None is returned.

    Wraps a function in a migration process. The function should return
    either a ready-to-use migration process object or a sequence containing
    implementations of migration command interfaces. Otherwise, an exception
    will be raised (see the `Raises` section).

    !!! note

        attribute, an `AttributeError` will be raised (see the `Raises`
        section).

    Parameters
    ----------
    process_func : types.FunctionType
        The function that returns either a ready-to-use migration process object
        or a sequence containing implementations of migration command interfaces.

    Returns
    -------
    domain_migration.MigrationProcess
        A migration process object that contains information about the migration
        version, process name, and set of migration commands. If the function
        returns an already created migration process, no new objects will be
        created.

    Raises
    ------

        If the function did not return an instance of the migration process
        class and the return value is not an instance of collections.abc.Sequence.
    AttributeError
        If the function did not return an instance of the migration process
        class and the module where the function is implemented does not contain
        the global value `version`.

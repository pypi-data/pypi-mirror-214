# QUIP - QUantum mechanics and Interatomic Potentials
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-public-brightgreen)](https://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/)
![build](https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP/actions/workflows/Build.yml/badge.svg)

The `QUIP` package is a collection of software tools to carry out
molecular dynamics simulations. It implements a variety of interatomic
potentials and tight binding quantum mechanics, and is also able to
call external packages, and serve as plugins to other software such as
[LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov), [CP2K](http://www.cp2k.org)
and also the python framework [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase).
Various hybrid combinations are also supported in the style of QM/MM,
with a particular focus on materials systems such as metals and
semiconductors.

For more details, see the [online documentation](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP). There is separate [documentation for SOAP and GAP](https://libatoms.github.io/GAP).

Long term support of the package is ensured by:
 - Noam Bernstein ([@bernstei](https://github.com/bernstei), Naval Research Laboratory)
 - Gabor Csanyi ([@gabor1](https://github.com/gabor1), University of Cambridge)
 - James Kermode ([@jameskermode](https://github.com/jameskermode), University of Warwick)

## Code philosophy and goals

QUIP was born because of the need to efficiently tie together a wide
variety of different models, both empirical and quantum mechanical. It
will not be competitive in terms of performance with codes such as LAMMPS
and Gromacs. The Atomic Simulation Environment also does this, and is
much more widely used, but QUIP has a number of unique features:

- Access to Fortran types and routines from Python via the
  `quippy` package
- Support for Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAP) - [online docs](https://libatoms.github.io/GAP)
- Does not assume minimum image convention, so interatomic potentials can
  have cutoffs that are larger than the periodic unit cell size

## Binary Installation of QUIP and quippy

Binary 
for QUIP and the associated quippy Python bindings
that provide interopability with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) are
available from the [Python package index](https://pypi.org/project/quippy-ase/)
(PyPI) under the package name `quippy-ase`.
This means you can install the latest release with:

```bash
pip install quippy-ase
```

Installing via `pip` also makes the `quip` and `gap_fit` command line
programs available (providing the [directory that pip installs scripts
to](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62162970/programmatically-determine-pip-user-install-location-scripts-directory/62167797#62167797) is on your `PATH`).

Currently, wheels are available for `x86_64` architectures
with Python 3.6+ on macOS and glibc-based Linux distributions
(e.g. Ubuntu, CentOS) and for macOS arm64. The wheels are updated periodically
using GitHub Actions CI. Please open [issues](https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP/issues)
here if you have problems installing with `pip`.

## Precompiled Containers

If you have access to [Docker](https://hub.docker.com) or
[Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov), you can try one of the
[precompiled images](https://github.com/libAtoms/quip-docker)
to get up and running quickly.

## Compilation Instructions

1.  To compile QUIP the minimum requirements are:

    - A working Fortran compiler. QUIP is tested with `gfortran` 4.4 and
      later, and `ifort` 11.1.

    - Linear algebra libraries BLAS and LAPACK. QUIP is tested with
      reference versions `libblas-dev` and `liblapack-dev` on Ubuntu
      12.04, and `mkl` 11.1 with `ifort`.

    - MPI: To use the MPI parallelisatin of `gap_fit`, you need a
      ScaLAPACK library, e.g. `libscalapack-openmpi` on Ubuntu, or
      as part of the MKL.

2.  Clone the QUIP repository from GitHub. The `--recursive` option
    brings in submodules automatically (If you don't do this, then
    you will need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
    from the top-level QUIP directory after cloning) ::
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP.git
    ```

    One submodule is the GAP code, which can be found in `src/GAP`.
    Note that GAP is distributed under a diferent
    [license](https://github.com/libAtoms/GAP/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

    GAP is a machine learning method that uses Gaussian process
    regression, and needs large data files to run. You can find
    potentials that have been published as well as training data in
    our [data repository](https://libatoms.github.io/GAP/data.html), see also the [online docs](https://libatoms.github.io/GAP).

3.  Decide your architecture by looking in the `arch/` directory, and
    define an environmental variable `QUIP_ARCH`, e.g.::
    ```bash
    export QUIP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_gfortran
    ```
    for standard gfortran on Linux. Here is where you can adjust which
    compiler is being used, if you do not like the defaults. You may need to
    create your own `arch/Makefile.${QUIP_ARCH}` file based on an existing file for
    more exotic systems.

    MPI: Some arch files already include adjustments for MPI use. Those
    usually have `mpi` in their name, e.g. `linux_x86_64_gfortran_openmpi+openmp`.

4.  Customise QUIP, set the maths libraries and provide linking options::
    ```bash
    make config
    ```
    Makefile.config will create a build directory, `build/${QUIP_ARCH}`,
    and all the building happen there. First it will ask you some
    questions about where you keep libraries and other stuff, if you
    don't use something it is asking for, just leave it blank. The
    answers will be stored in `Makefile.inc` in the `build/${QUIP_ARCH}`
    directory, and you can edit them later (e.g. to change compiler, optimisation
    or debug options).

    If you later make significant changes to the configuration such as
    enabling or disabling tight-binding support you should force a
    full rebuild by doing a `make deepclean; make`.

    MPI: To use the MPI parallelisation of `gap_fit`, you have to add
    your system library to the linking options, e.g. `-lscalapack` or
    `-lscalapack-openmpi`, enable GAP support, enable QR decomposition,
    and enable ScaLAPACK.

5.  Compile all programs, modules and libraries::
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    From the top-level `QUIP` directory. All programs are built in
    `build/${QUIP_ARCH}/`. You can also find compiled object files
    and libraries (`libquip.a`) in that directory. Programs can be
    called directly from that directory.

    Other useful make targets include:

    - `make install` : copies all compiled programs it can find to
      `QUIP_INSTALLDIR`, if it's defined and is a directory (full path
      required), and copies bundled structures to `QUIP_STRUCTS_DIR`
      if it is defined.

    - `make libquip`:   Compile QUIP as a library and link to it.
      This will make all the various libraries and combine them into one:
      `build/${QUIP_ARCH}/libquip.a`, which is what you need to link with
      (as well as LAPACK).

6.  A good starting point is to use the `quip` program, which can
    calculate the properties of an atomic configuration using a
    variety of models. For example::
    ```bash
    quip atoms_filename=test.xyz init_args='IP LJ' \
        param_filename=share/Parameters/ip.parms.LJ.xml E
    ```
    assuming that you have a file called `test.xyz` with the following
    data in it representing Cu atoms in a cubic fcc lattice::
    ```
    4
    Lattice="3.61 0 0 0 3.61 0 0 0 3.61" Properties=species:S:1:pos:R:3
    Cu     0.000 0.000 0.000
    Cu     0.000 1.805 1.805
    Cu     1.805 0.000 1.805
    Cu     1.805 1.805 0.000
    ```
    The Lennard-Jones parameters in the above example are defined in the
    `ip.parms.LJ.xml` file under `share/Parameters` (ensure the path
    to this file is correct). The format of the atomic configuration is
    given in
    [Extended XYZ](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/io.html#extendedxyz)
    format, in which the first line is the number of atoms, the second line
    is a series of key=value pairs, which must at least contain the Lattice
    key giving the periodic bounding box and the Properties key that
    describes the remaining lines. The value of Properties is a sequence of
    triplets separated by a colon (:), that give the name, type and number
    of columns, with the type given by I for integers, R for reals, S for
    strings.

    Most string arguments can be replaced by `--help` and QUIP programs
    will  then print  a  list  of allowable  keywords  with brief  help
    messages as to their usage,  so e.g. `init_args=--help` will give a
    list of potential model  types (and some combinations). The parsing
    is recursive,  so `init_args="IP --help"`  will then proceed  to list
    the types of interatomic potentials (IP) that are available.

7.  To compile the Python wrappers (`quippy`), the minimum requirements
    are as follows. `f90wrap` will be installed automatically by the build
    process, but you might need to check that the directory where `pip`
    installs executuable scripts to is on your path (e.g. by setting
    `PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH`).
    - Python 3
    - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) (`numpy>=1.5.0`)
    - [Atomic Simulation Environment ](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (`ase>=3.17.0`)
    - [f90wrap](https://github.com/jameskermode/f90wrap)
    - (optional) [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)
    - (optional) [matscipy](https://github.com/libAtoms/matscipy).

    Note: If you are using a Python virtual environment (virtualenv) and would like
    to install `quippy` into it, ensure the environment is activated
    (`source <env_dir>/bin/activate`, where `<env_dir>` is the root of
    your virtual environment) _before_ building `quippy` (otherwise library
    versions may cause unexpected conflicts).

8.  To compile the Python wrappers (`quippy`), run::
    ```bash
    make quippy
    ```
    Quippy can be used by adding the `lib` directory in
    `quippy/build/${QUIP_ARCH}` to your `$PYTHONPATH`, however it can be
    more convenient to install into a specific Python distribution::
    ```bash
    make install-quippy
    ```
    will either install into the current virtualenv or attempt to install
    systemwide (usually fails without `sudo`). To install only for the
    current user (into `~/.local`), execute the command
    `QUIPPY_INSTALL_OPTS=--user make install-quippy`,
    or use `QUIPPY_INSTALL_OPTS=--prefix=<directory>` to install into a
    specific directory. `QUIPPY_INSTALL_OPTS` can also be set in the file
    `build/${QUIP_ARCH}/Makefile.inc`.

9.  More details on the quippy installation process and troubleshooting for
    common build problems are available in the
    [online documentation](http://libatoms.github.io/QUIP/).

10.  To run the unit and regression tests, which depend on `quippy`::
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

11.  To get back to a state near to a fresh clone, use
    ```bash
    make distclean
    ```

12. Some functionality is only available if you check out other
    modules within the `QUIP/src/` directories, e.g. the `ThirdParty`
    (DFTB parameters, TTM3f water model).

13. In order to run QUIP potentials via LAMMPS, `make libquip` to get QUIP
    into library form, and then follow the instructions in the
    [LAMMPS documentation](http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_quip.html). You need at least 11 Aug 2017 version or later.

# Developer notes:

## Fixing/updating the version of GAP:

  ```bash
  cd src/GAP
  ```
  ```bash
  git checkout <commit>
  ```
  OR
  ```bash
  git checkout main

  ```
  Updating the version in the `QUIP` repository:
  ```
  cd ../..
  git add src/GAP
  git commit -m "updating the version of GAP"
  ```

## Mac OS

We do not recommend Apple-shipped compilers and python, and we do not test
compatibility with them. Either use MacPorts or Homebrew to obtain GNU compilers,
and also use the python from there or Anaconda. As of this edit, gcc-8.1 produces as
internal compiler error, but gcc-4.6 through to gcc-7 is fine.

## Triggering the wheel build

Wheels are built on push and pull requests to `public` using [cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
with [this workflow](.github/workflows/build-wheels.yml).

To make a release candidate create a tag with a suffix such as `-rc1` for the first attempt,
push to trigger the build:

```bash
git commit -m 'release v0.x.z-rc1'
git tag v0.x.y-rc1
git push --tags
```

If all goes well, the `.whl` files will show up as assets within a new GitHub
release. The installation process can now be tested locally.

## Release wheels to PyPI

Once everything works correctly, make a full release (i.e. create a tag named
just `v0.x.y` without the `-rc1` suffix). This will trigger the upload of wheels
and source distribution to PyPI.

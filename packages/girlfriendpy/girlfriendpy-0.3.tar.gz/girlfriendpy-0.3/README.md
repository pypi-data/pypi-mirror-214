# gf.py

> i think i have a gf i dont entirely know how a gf is defined but i think she is so i made this library to help me


this is a python port of [gf.js](https://github.com/mintexists/gf.js)

## what is it
this is a library to help me know if she is my girlfriend or not

## why does this exist?
gf.js exists, but I don't like js, so I ported it to python

## usage
```shell
# to install it to your env
$ pip install girlfriendpy
```
```python
from gf import gf
print(type(gf)) # None
```

## development
any issues or pr's that has more input on this would be helpful

## why should I care?
I'm very gay, thanks.

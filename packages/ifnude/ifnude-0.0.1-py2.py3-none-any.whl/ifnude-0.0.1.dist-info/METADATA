# ifnude

ifnude is a neural net powered library that takes an input as input and tells you exactly what NSFW parts of the body are visible. It also allows you to censor the said parts.

Works on both on humans and drawings.

### Installation
```bash
pip install --upgrade ifnude
```

### Example
```python
from ifnude import detect

# use mode="fast" for x3 speed with slightly lower accuracy
print(detect('/path/to/nsfw.png'))
```

#### Output
```
[{'box': [164, 188, 246, 271], 'score': 0.8253238201141357, 'label': 'EXPOSED_BREAST_F'}, {'box': [252, 190, 335, 270], 'score': 0.8235630989074707, 'label': 'EXPOSED_BREAST_F'}]
```

### Credits
This is fork of [NudeNet](https://pypi.org/project/NudeNet/) library which doesn't work anymore. I have taken the liberty to remove the video detection functionality as it was prone to crashes.

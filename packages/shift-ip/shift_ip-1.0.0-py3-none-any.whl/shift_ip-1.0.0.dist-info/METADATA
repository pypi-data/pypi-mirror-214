## Motivation
The development of SHIFT was motivated by the need to automate and streamline the process of bypassing reverse proxies like Cloudflare. In shared hosting environments, multiple domains and subdomains often share the same IP address, presenting a significant challenge for penetration testers and security analysts seeking to identify the precise IP addresses associated with specific domains.

Manually determining the correct IP address for a domain hosted on shared hosting platforms can be a laborious and error-prone task. It typically involves time-consuming manual checks, leading to delays in conducting security assessments and penetration testing activities.

## Features

- [x] Checks range of IP addresses.
- [ ] Set timeout paramter.
- [ ] Add request headers parameter.
- [ ] Show response headers.
- [ ] Check list of IP addresses.
- [ ] Check for a list of domain names.
- [ ] Import list of IP addresses from .txt file.
- [ ] Import list of  domain names From .txt file.
- [ ] Customize check criteria.

## Install
```sh
pip install shift-ip 

```

## Usage
**Syntax**
```sh
shift IP DOMAIN
```

-  Check IP addresses range: between `1` and `24`.
```sh
shift 127.0.0.1/24 example.com
```
**Request headers**

- `Host` header is automatically added. In HTTP it specifies the target server's domain or host name, enabling clients to access specific domains or subdomains hosted on servers with multiple websites.

**Check criteria**

- `Namecheap` shared hosting: valid IP has redirect status response code `301`.
